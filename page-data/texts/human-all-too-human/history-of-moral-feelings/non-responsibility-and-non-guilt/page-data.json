All his estimates,\npreferences, dislikes are thus made worthless and false. His deepest\nsentiment, with which he honored the sufferer, the hero, sprang from an\nerror. He may no longer praise, no longer blame, for it is irrational to\nblame and praise nature and necessity. Just as he cherishes the\nbeautiful work of art, but does not praise it (as it is incapable of\ndoing anything for itself), just as he stands in the presence of plants,\nhe must stand in the presence of human conduct, his own included. He may\nadmire strength, beauty, capacity, therein, but he can discern no merit.\nThe chemical process and the conflict of the elements, the ordeal of\nthe invalid who strives for convalescence, are no more merits than the\nsoul-struggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that by\ncontending motives until one finally decides in favor of the\nstrongest—as the phrase has it, although, in fact, it is the strongest\nmotive that decides for us.

The degrees of rational capacity\ndetermine the direction in which this longing impels: every society,\nevery individual has constantly present a comparative classification of\nbenefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others are\njudged. But this standard perpetually changes. Many acts are called bad\nthat are only stupid, because the degree of intelligence that decided\nfor them was low. Indeed, in a certain sense, all acts now are stupid,\nfor the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attained\nwill in time most certainly be surpassed and then, in retrospection, all\nour present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as we\nnow deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and ages.—To\nperceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there is,\nnevertheless, a consolation. Such pains are birth pains. The butterfly\ninsists upon breaking through the cocoon, he presses through it, tears\nit to pieces, only to be blinded and confused by the strange light, by\nthe realm of liberty. By such men as are capable of this sadness—how\nfew there are!—will the first attempt be made to see if humanity may\nconvert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom. The sun of\na new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the souls\nof those few: but the clouds are massed there, too, thicker than ever,\nand not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom.\nEverything is necessity—so says the new knowledge: and this knowledge\nis itself necessity. All is guiltlessness, and knowledge is the way to\ninsight into this guiltlessness. If pleasure, egoism, vanity be\nnecessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms, the\ninstinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge; if delusion and confusion\nof the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could gradually\nlift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and self\nemancipation—who would venture to disparage the means?
