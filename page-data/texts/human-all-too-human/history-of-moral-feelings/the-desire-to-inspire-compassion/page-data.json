Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to\nbe compassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their\ncondition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and the\noppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing, the\nposturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the\ncausing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholder\nmanifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much as\nthey are made to perceive that at least they have the power,\nnotwithstanding all their weakness, to inflict pain. The unfortunate\nexperiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which the\nmanifestation of sympathy entails; his imagination is exalted; he is\nalways strong enough, then, to cause the world pain. Thus is the thirst\nfor sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of one’s\nfellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dear\nself: not in his mere “dullness” as La Rochefoucauld thinks.—In social\nconversation three fourths of all the questions are asked, and three\nfourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some little\npain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it gives them\na sense of their power. In these countless but very small doses in which\nthe quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant of\nlife: to the same extent that well wishing—(Wohl-wollen) distributed\nthrough the world in like manner, is one of the ever ready\nrestoratives.—But will many honorable people be found to admit that\nthere is any pleasure in administering pain? that entertainment—and\nrare entertainment—is not seldom found in causing others, at least in\nthought, some pain, and in raking them with the small shot of\nwickedness? The majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to know\nanything of this pudendum: the latter may, consequently, be prompt to\ndeny that Prosper Mérimée is right when he says: “Know, also, that\nnothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/human-all-too-human/history-of-moral-feelings/how-appearance-becomes-reality/\">How Appearance Becomes Reality.</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Desire to Inspire Compassion."}]},{"type":"text","value":"—La Rochefoucauld, in the most\nnotable part of his self portraiture (first printed 1658) reaches the\nvital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on\ntheir guard against compassion, when he advises that this sentiment be\nleft to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the\nemotions (since they are not guided by reason) to induce them to give\naid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune: whereas\ncompassion, in his (and Plato’s) view, deprives the heart of strength.\nTo be sure, sympathy should be manifested but men should take care not\nto feel it; for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the\nmanifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the\nworld.—Perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can be\ngiven if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply as\nstupidity and intellectual weakness, not as a sort of distraction of the\nspirit entailed by misfortune itself (and thus, indeed, does La\nRochefoucauld seem to view it) but as something quite different and more\nmomentous.
