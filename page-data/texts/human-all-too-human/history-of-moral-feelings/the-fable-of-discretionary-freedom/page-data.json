At first\nsingle actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their\nmotive, but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial\nconsequences they have for the community. In time, however, the origin\nof these designations is forgotten [but] it is imagined that action in\nitself, without reference to its consequences, contains the property\n“good” or “bad”: with the same error according to which language\ndesignates the stone itself as hard[ness] the tree itself as\ngreen[ness]—for the reason, therefore, that what is a consequence is\ncomprehended as a cause. Accordingly, the good[ness] or bad[ness] is\nincorporated into the motive and [any] deed by itself is regarded as\nmorally ambiguous. A step further is taken, and the predication good or\nbad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire nature\nof a man, out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil.\nThus man is successively made responsible for his [particular] acts,\nthen for his [course of] conduct, then for his motives and finally for\nhis nature. Now, at last, is it discovered that this nature, even,\ncannot be responsible, inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessary\nconsequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of past\nand present things: therefore, that man is to be made responsible for\nnothing, neither for his nature, nor his motives, nor his [course of]\nconduct nor his [particular] acts. By this [process] is gained the\nknowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of error,\nof the error of responsibility: as is whatever rests upon the error of\nthe freedom of the will. Schopenhauer concluded just the other way,\nthus: since certain actions bring depression (“consciousness of guilt”)\nin their train, there must, then, exist responsibility, for there would\nbe no basis for this depression at hand if all man’s affairs did not\nfollow their course of necessity—as they do, indeed, according to the\nopinion of this philosopher, follow their course—but man himself,\nsubject to the same necessity, would be just the man that he is—which\nSchopenhauer denies. From the fact of such depression Schopenhauer\nbelieves himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have\nhad, not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature:\nfreedom, therefore, to be thus and so, not to act thus and so. Out of\nthe <em>esse</em>, the sphere of freedom and responsibility, follows, according\nto his opinion, the <em>operari</em>, the spheres of invariable causation,\nnecessity and irresponsibility. This depression, indeed, is due\napparently to the <em>operari</em>—in so far as it be delusive—but in truth\nto whatever <em>esse</em> be the deed of a free will, the basic cause of the\nexistence of an individual: [in order to] let man become whatever he\nwills to become, his [to] will (Wollen) must precede his\nexistence.—Here, apart from the absurdity of the statement just made,\nthere is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depression\nexplains its character, the rational admissibility of it: from such a\nwrong inference does Schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequent\nof the so called discretionary freedom (intelligibeln Freiheit). (For\nthe origin of this fabulous entity Plato and Kant are equally\nresponsible). But depression after the act does not need to be rational:\nindeed, it is certainly not so at all, for it rests upon the erroneous\nassumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass.\nTherefore: only because man deems himself free, but not because\nhe is free, does he experience remorse and the stings of\nconscience.—Moreover, this depression is something that can be grown\nout of; in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts\nwhich inspire it in many other men. It is a very varying thing and one\nclosely connected with the development of custom and civilization, and\nperhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the world’s\nhistory.—No one is responsible for his acts, no one for his nature; to\njudge is tantamount to being unjust. This applies as well when the\nindividual judges himself. The proposition is as clear as sunlight, and\nyet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for fear\nof the consequences.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/human-all-too-human/history-of-moral-feelings/above-animal/\">Above Animal.</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Fable of Discretionary Freedom."}]},{"type":"text","value":"—The history of the feelings, on\nthe basis of which we make everyone responsible, hence, the so-called\nmoral feelings, is traceable in the following leading phases.
