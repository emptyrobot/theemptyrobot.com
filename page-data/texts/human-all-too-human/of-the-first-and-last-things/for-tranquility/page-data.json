A question seems\nto weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words: whether\none <em>can</em> knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful? or, if one\n<em>must</em>, whether, then, death would not be preferable? For there is no\nlonger any ought (Sollen), morality; so far as it is involved “ought,”\nis, through our point of view, as utterly annihilated as religion. Our\nknowledge can permit only pleasure and pain, benefit and injury, to\nsubsist as motives. But how can these motives be distinguished from the\ndesire for truth? Even they rest upon error (in so far, as already\nstated, partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimates\npalpably modify our pleasure and our pain). The whole of human life is\ndeeply involved in <em>untruth</em>. The individual cannot extricate it from\nthis pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole past,\nwithout finding his present motives of conduct, (as that of honor)\nillegitimate, and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitions\nwhich prompt one to have regard for the future and for one’s happiness\nin the future. Is it true, does there, then, remain but one way of\nthinking, which, as a personal consequence brings in its train despair,\nand as a theoretical [consequence brings in its train] a philosophy of\ndecay, disintegration, self annihilation? I believe the deciding\ninfluence, as regards the after-effect of knowledge, will be the\n<em>temperament</em> of a man; I can, in addition to this after-effect just\nmentioned, suppose another, by means of which a much simpler life, and\none freer from disturbances than the present, could be lived; so that at\nfirst the old motives of vehement passion might still have strength,\nowing to hereditary habit, but they would gradually grow weaker under\nthe influence of purifying knowledge. A man would live, at last, both\namong men and unto himself, as in the natural state, without praise,\nreproach, competition, feasting one’s eyes, as if it were a play, upon\nmuch that formerly inspired dread. One would be rid of the strenuous\nelement, and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man is\nnot even [as much as] nature, nor more than nature. To be sure, this\nrequires, as already stated, a good temperament, a fortified, gentle and\nnaturally cheerful soul, a disposition that has no need to be on its\nguard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that in\nits utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone—those\nfamiliar, disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that have\nbeen a long time chained up. Rather must a man, from whom the ordinary\nbondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent, so do that he\nonly lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge, and to learn to\nresign, without envy and without disappointment, much, yes nearly\neverything, that has value in the eyes of men. He must be content with\nsuch a free, fearless soaring above men, manners, laws and traditional\nestimates of things, as the most desirable of all situations. He will\nfreely share the joy of being in such a situation, and he has, perhaps,\nnothing else to share—in which renunciation and self-denial really most\nconsist. But if more is asked of him, he will, with a benevolent shake\nof the head, refer to his brother, the free man of fact, and will,\nperhaps, not dissemble a little contempt: for, as regards his “freedom,”\nthereby hangs a tale.<sup id=\"fnref-18\"><a href=\"#fn-18\" class=\"footnote-ref\">18</a></sup></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/human-all-too-human/history-of-moral-feelings/advantages-of-psychological-observation/\">Advantages of Psychological Observation.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-18\">\n<p>den mit dessen “Freiheit” hat es eine eigene Bewandtniss.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-18\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For Tranquility."}]},{"type":"text","value":"—But will not our philosophy become thus a tragedy?\nWill not truth prove the enemy of life, of betterment?
