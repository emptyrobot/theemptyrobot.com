Almost all the organs act\nindependently and vigorously. The blood circulates rapidly. The posture\nof the sleeper compresses some portions of the body. The coverlets\ninfluence the sensations in different ways. The stomach carries on the\ndigestive process and acts upon other organs thereby. The intestines are\nin motion. The position of the head induces unaccustomed action. The\nfeet, shoeless, no longer pressing the ground, are the occasion of other\nsensations of novelty, as is, indeed, the changed garb of the entire\nbody. All these things, following the bustle and change of the day,\nresult, through their novelty, in a movement throughout the entire\nsystem that extends even to the brain functions. Thus there are a\nhundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind, a questioning as\nto the cause of this excitation. Now, the dream is a <em>seeking and\npresenting of reasons</em> for these excitations of feeling, of the supposed\nreasons, that is to say. Thus, for example, whoever has his feet bound\nwith two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiled\nabout his feet. This is at first a hypothesis, then a belief with an\naccompanying imaginative picture and the argument: “these snakes must be\nthe <em>causa</em> of those sensations which I, the sleeper, now have.” So\nreasons the mind of the sleeper. The conditions precedent, as thus\nconjectured, become, owing to the excitation of the fancy, present\nrealities. Everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transform\none piercing sound, for example, that of a bell, into another of quite a\ndifferent nature, say, the report of cannon. In his dream he becomes\naware first of the effects, which he explains by a subsequent hypothesis\nand becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound. But\nhow comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when the\nsame mind, awake, is habitually cautious, careful, and so conservative\nin its dealings with hypotheses? why does the first plausible\nhypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreaming\nstate? (For in a dream we look upon that dream as reality, that is, we\naccept our hypotheses as fully established). I have no doubt that as men\nargue in their dreams to-day, mankind argued, even in their waking\nmoments, for thousands of years: the first <em>causa</em>, that occurred to the\nmind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation, was\naccepted as the true explanation and served as such. (Savages show the\nsame tendency in operation, as the reports of travelers agree). In the\ndream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within\nus, for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty\ndeveloped itself and still develops itself in every individual. Dreams\ncarry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us a\nmeans of understanding it more clearly. Dream thought comes so easily to\nus now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the\ninterminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facile\nform of theorising has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream is a\nrestorative for the brain, which, during the day, is called upon to meet\nthe many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of a\nhigher civilization.—We may, if we please, become sensible, even in our\nwaking moments, of a condition that is as a door and vestibule to\ndreaming. If we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up a\nmedley of impressions of light and color, apparently a sort of imitation\nand echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its waking\nmoments. And now the mind, in co-operation with the imagination,\ntransforms this formless play of light and color into definite figures,\nmoving groups, landscapes. What really takes place is a sort of\nreasoning from effect back to cause. As the brain inquires: whence these\nimpressions of light and color? it posits as the inducing causes of such\nlights and colors, those shapes and figures. They serve the brain as the\noccasions of those lights and colors because the brain, when the eyes\nare open and the senses awake, is accustomed to perceiving the cause of\nevery impression of light and color made upon it. Here again the\nimagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as it\nparticipates in the production of the impressions made through the\nsenses day by day: and the dream-fancy does exactly the same thing—that\nis, the presumed cause is determined from the effect and <em>after</em> the\neffect: all this, too, with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this\nmatter, as in a matter of jugglery or sleight-of-hand, a confusion of\nthe mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear a\nsimultaneous action, an inverted succession of events, even.—From\nthese considerations we can see how <em>late</em> strict, logical thought, the\ntrue notion of cause and effect must have been in developing, since our\nintellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to these\nprimitive processes of deduction, while practically half our lifetime is\nspent in the super-inducing conditions.—Even the poet, the artist,\nascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are not\nthe true ones.
