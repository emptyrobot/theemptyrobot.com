What!? Everything is merely—human—all too human?\nWith this exclamation my writings are gone through, not without a\ncertain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a disposition\nto ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simply\nmisrepresented. My writings have been termed a school of distrust, still\nmore of disdain: also, and more happily, of courage, audacity even. And\nin fact, I myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the world\nwith a distrust as deep as mine, seeming, as I do, not simply the timely\nadvocate of the devil, but, to employ theological terms, an enemy and\nchallenger of God; and whosoever has experienced any of the consequences\nof such deep distrust, anything of the chills and the agonies of\nisolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemns\nhim endowed with it, will also understand how often I must have sought\nrelief and self-forgetfulness from any source—through any object of\nveneration or enmity, of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness;\nalso why I, when I could not find what I was in need of, had to fashion\nit for myself, counterfeiting it or imagining it (and what poet or\nwriter has ever done anything else, and what other purpose can all the\nart in the world possibly have?) That which I always stood most in need\nof in order to effect my cure and self-recovery was faith, faith enough\nnot to be thus isolated, not to look at life from so singular a point of\nview—a magic apprehension (in eye and mind) of relationship and\nequality, a calm confidence in friendship, a blindness, free from\nsuspicion and questioning, to two sidedness; a pleasure in externals,\nsuperficialities, the near, the accessible, in all things possessed of\ncolor, skin and seeming. Perhaps I could be fairly reproached with much\n“art” in this regard, many fine counterfeitings; for example, that,\nwisely or wilfully, I had shut my eyes to Schopenhauer’s blind will\ntowards ethic, at a time when I was already clear sighted enough on the\nsubject of ethic; likewise that I had deceived myself concerning Richard\nWagner’s incurable romanticism, as if it were a beginning and not an\nend; likewise concerning the Greeks, likewise concerning the Germans and\ntheir future—and there may be, perhaps, a long list of such likewises.\nGranted, however, that all this were true, and with justice urged\nagainst me, what does it signify, what can it signify in regard to how\nmuch of the self-sustaining capacity, how much of reason and higher\nprotection are embraced in such self-deception?—and how much more\nfalsity is still necessary to me that I may therewith always reassure\nmyself regarding the luxury of my truth. Enough, I still live; and life\nis not considered now apart from ethic; it <em>will</em> [have] deception; it\nthrives (lebt) on deception … but am I not beginning to do all over\nagain what I have always done, I, the old immoralist, and bird\nsnarer—talk unmorally, ultramorally, “beyond good and evil”?</p>\n<p>Thus, then, have I evolved for myself the “free spirits” to whom this\ndiscouraging-encouraging work, under the general title “Human, All Too\nHuman,” is dedicated. Such “free spirits” do not really exist and never\ndid exist. But I stood in need of them, as I have pointed out, in order\nthat some good might be mixed with my evils (illness, loneliness,\nstrangeness, <em>acedia</em>, incapacity): to serve as gay spirits and\ncomrades, with whom one may talk and laugh when one is disposed to talk\nand laugh, and whom one may send to the devil when they grow wearisome.\nThey are some compensation for the lack of friends. That such free\nspirits can possibly exist, that our Europe will yet number among her\nsons of to-morrow or of the day after to-morrow, such a brilliant and\nenthusiastic company, alive and palpable and not merely, as in my case,\nfantasms and imaginary shades, I, myself, can by no means doubt. I see\nthem already coming, slowly, slowly. May it not be that I am doing a\nlittle something to expedite their coming when I describe in advance the\ninfluences under which I see them evolving and the ways along which they\ntravel?</p>\n<p>It may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of “free spirit” can\nattain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event in\nthe form of a great emancipation or unbinding, and that prior to that\nevent it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its place\nand pillar. What binds strongest? What cords seem almost unbreakable? In\nthe case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of\nduty: that reverence, which in youth is most typical, that timidity and\ntenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthy,\nthat gratitude to the soil from which we sprung, for the hand that\nguided us, for the relic before which we were taught to pray—their\nsublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly. The\ngreat liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners, like an earthquake:\nthe young soul is all at once shaken, torn apart, cast forth—it\ncomprehends not itself what is taking place. An involuntary onward\nimpulse rules them with the mastery of command; a will, a wish are\ndeveloped to go forward, anywhere, at any price; a strong, dangerous\ncuriosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in all\ntheir being. “Better to die than live <em>here</em>“—so sounds the tempting\nvoice: and this “here,” this “at home” constitutes all they have\nhitherto loved. A sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved, a\nflash of contempt for that which is called their “duty,” a mutinous,\nwilful, volcanic-like longing for a far away journey, strange scenes and\npeople, annihilation, petrifaction, a hatred surmounting love, perhaps a\nsacrilegious impulse and look backwards, to where they so long prayed\nand loved, perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the same\ntime an exultation at having done it, an inner, intoxicating,\ndelightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory—a victory?\nover what? over whom? a riddle-like victory, fruitful in questioning and\nwell worth questioning, but the <em>first</em> victory, for all—such things of\npain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation. And it is at\nthe same time a malady that can destroy a man, this first outbreak of\nstrength and will for self-destination, self-valuation, this will for\nfree will: and how much illness is forced to the surface in the frantic\nstrivings and singularities with which the freedman, the liberated seeks\nhenceforth to attest his mastery over things! He roves fiercely around,\nwith an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter must\nsuffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride; he tears to pieces\nwhatever attracts him. With a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever he\nfinds veiled or protected by any reverential awe: he would see what\nthese things look like when they are overturned. It is wilfulness and\ndelight in the wilfulness of it, if he now, perhaps, gives his approval\nto that which has heretofore been in ill repute—if, in curiosity and\nexperiment, he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things. In\nthe background during all his plunging and roaming—for he is as\nrestless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wilderness—is the\ninterrogation mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous. “Can we\nnot upset every standard? and is good perhaps evil? and God only an\ninvention and a subtlety of the devil? Is everything, in the last\nresort, false? And if we are dupes are we not on that very account\ndupers also? <em>must</em> we not be dupers also?” Such reflections lead and\nmislead him, ever further on, ever further away. Solitude, that dread\ngoddess and mater saeva cupidinum, encircles and besets him, ever more\nthreatening, more violent, more heart breaking—but who to-day knows\nwhat solitude is?</p>\n<p>From this morbid solitude, from the deserts of such trial years, the way\nis yet far to that great, overflowing certainty and healthiness which\ncannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook of\nknowledge; to that matured freedom of the spirit which is, in an equal\ndegree, self mastery and discipline of the heart, and gives access to\nthe path of much and various reflection—to that inner comprehensiveness\nand self satisfaction of over-richness which precludes all danger that\nthe spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sitting\nintoxicated in some corner or other; to that overplus of plastic,\nhealing, imitative and restorative power which is the very sign of\nvigorous health, that overplus which confers upon the free spirit the\nperilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of running\nadventurous risks: the past-master-privilege of the free spirit. In the\ninterval there may be long years of convalescence, years filled with\nmany hued painfully-bewitching transformations, dominated and led to the\ngoal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assume\nthe guise and the disguise of health. There is a middle ground to this,\nwhich a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion;\nhe basks in a special fine sun of his own, with a feeling of birdlike\nfreedom, birdlike visual power, birdlike irrepressibleness, a something\nextraneous (Drittes) in which curiosity and delicate disdain have\nunited. A “free spirit”—this refreshing term is grateful in any mood,\nit almost sets one aglow. One lives—no longer in the bonds of love and\nhate, without a yes or no, here or there indifferently, best pleased to\nevade, to avoid, to beat about, neither advancing nor retreating. One is\nhabituated to the bad, like a person who all at once sees a fearful\nhurly-burly <em>beneath</em> him—and one was the counterpart of him who\nbothers himself with things that do not concern him. As a matter of fact\nthe free spirit is bothered with mere things—and how many\nthings—which no longer <em>concern</em> him.</p>\n<p>A step further in recovery: and the free spirit draws near to life\nagain, slowly indeed, almost refractorily, almost distrustfully. There\nis again warmth and mellowness: feeling and fellow feeling acquire\ndepth, lambent airs stir all about him. He almost feels: it seems as if\nnow for the first time his eyes are open to things <em>near</em>. He is in\namaze and sits hushed: for where had he been? These near and immediate\nthings: how changed they seem to him! He looks gratefully back—grateful\nfor his wandering, his self exile and severity, his lookings afar and\nhis bird flights in the cold heights. How fortunate that he has not,\nlike a sensitive, dull home body, remained always “in the house” and “at\nhome!” He had been beside himself, beyond a doubt. Now for the first\ntime he really sees himself—and what surprises in the process. What\nhitherto unfelt tremors! Yet what joy in the exhaustion, the old\nsickness, the relapses of the convalescent! How it delights him,\nsuffering, to sit still, to exercise patience, to lie in the sun! Who so\nwell as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even in\nwinter, who delights more in the sunshine athwart the wall? They are\nthe most appreciative creatures in the world, and also the most humble,\nthese convalescents and lizards, crawling back towards life: there are\nsome among them who can let no day slip past them without addressing\nsome song of praise to its retreating light. And speaking seriously, it\nis a fundamental cure for all pessimism (the cankerous vice, as is well\nknown, of all idealists and humbugs), to become ill in the manner of\nthese free spirits, to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit grow\nhealthy—I mean healthier. It is wisdom, worldly wisdom, to administer\neven health to oneself for a long time in small doses.</p>\n<p>About this time it becomes at last possible, amid the flash lights of a\nstill unestablished, still precarious health, for the free, the ever\nfreer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation, a\nriddle which has hitherto lingered, obscure, well worth questioning,\nalmost impalpable, in his memory. If once he hardly dared to ask “why so\napart? so alone? renouncing all I loved? renouncing respect itself? why\nthis coldness, this suspicion, this hate for one’s very virtues?”—now\nhe dares, and asks it loudly, already hearing the answer, “you had to\nbecome master over yourself, master of your own good qualities. Formerly\nthey were your masters: but they should be merely your tools along with\nother tools. You had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn to\nhold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims. You had to\ngrasp the perspective of every representation (Werthschätzung)—the\ndislocation, distortion and the apparent end or teleology of the\nhorizon, besides whatever else appertains to the perspective: also the\nelement of demerit in its relation to opposing merit, and the whole\nintellectual cost of every affirmative, every negative. You had to find\nout the <em>inevitable</em> error<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> in every Yes and in every No, error as\ninseparable from life, life itself as conditioned by the perspective and\nits inaccuracy.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> Above all, you had to see with your own eyes where\nthe error<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> is always greatest: there, namely, where life is littlest,\nnarrowest, meanest, least developed and yet cannot help looking upon\nitself as the goal and standard of things, and smugly and ignobly and\nincessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest and\nrichest, and putting the shreds into the form of questions from the\nstandpoint of its own well being. You had to see with your own eyes the\nproblem of classification, (Rangordnung, regulation concerning rank and\nstation) and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upward\ntogether: You had”—enough, the free spirit knows henceforward which\n“you had” it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now, for\nthe first time, <em>dare</em>.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the free spirit works out for itself an answer to that\nriddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon its\nexperience in the following fashion: “What I went through everyone must\ngo through” in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itself\nforth. The inner power and inevitability of this problem will assert\nthemselves in due course, as in the case of any unsuspected\npregnancy—long before the spirit has seen this problem in its true\naspect and learned to call it by its right name. Our destiny exercises\nits influence over us even when, as yet, we have not learned its nature:\nit is our future that lays down the law to our to-day. Granted, that it\nis the problem of classification<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> of which we free spirits may say,\nthis is <em>our</em> problem, yet it is only now, in the midday of our life,\nthat we fully appreciate what preparations, shifts, trials, ordeals,\nstages, were essential to that problem before it could emerge to our\nview, and why we had to go through the various and contradictory\nlongings and satisfactions of body and soul, as circumnavigators and\nadventurers of that inner world called “man”; as surveyors of that\n“higher” and of that “progression”<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> that is also called\n“man”—crowding in everywhere, almost without fear, disdaining nothing,\nmissing nothing, testing everything, sifting everything and eliminating\nthe chance impurities—until at last we could say, we free spirits:\n“Here—a <em>new</em> problem! Here, a long ladder on the rungs of which we\nourselves have rested and risen, which we have actually been at times.\nHere is a something higher, a something deeper, a something below us, a\nvastly extensive order, (Ordnung) a comparative classification\n(Rangordnung), that we perceive: here—<em>our</em> problem!”</p>\n<p>To what stage in the development just outlined the present book belongs\n(or is assigned) is something that will be hidden from no augur or\npsychologist for an instant. But where are there psychologists to-day?\nIn France, certainly; in Russia, perhaps; certainly not in Germany.\nGrounds are not wanting, to be sure, upon which the Germans of to-day\nmay adduce this fact to their credit: unhappily for one who in this\nmatter is fashioned and mentored in an un-German school!
