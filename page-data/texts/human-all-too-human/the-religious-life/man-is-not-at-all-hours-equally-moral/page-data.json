If one’s\nmorality be judged according to one’s capacity for great, self\nsacrificing resolutions and abnegations (which when continual, and made\na habit are known as sanctity) one is, in affection, or disposition, the\nmost moral: while higher excitement supplies wholly new impulses which,\nwere one calm and cool as ordinarily, one would not deem oneself even\ncapable of.
