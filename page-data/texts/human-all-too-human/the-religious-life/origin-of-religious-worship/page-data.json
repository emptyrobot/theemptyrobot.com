In those times nothing is yet known of\nnature’s laws. Neither for earth nor for heaven is there a must. A\nseason, sunshine, rain can come or stay away as it pleases. There is\nwanting, in particular, all idea of natural causation. If a man rows, it\nis not the oar that moves the boat, but rowing is a magical ceremony\nwhereby a demon is constrained to move the boat. All illness, death\nitself, is a consequence of magical influences. In sickness and death\nnothing natural is conceived. The whole idea of “natural course” is\nwanting. The idea dawns first upon the ancient Greeks, that is to say in\na very late period of humanity, in the conception of a Moira [fate]\nruling over the gods. If any person shoots off a bow, there is always an\nirrational strength and agency in the act. If the wells suddenly run\ndry, the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks. It\nmust have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence a\nhuman being suddenly collapses. In India, the carpenter (according to\nLubbock) is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer and\nhatchet. A Brahmin treats the plume with which he writes, a soldier the\nweapon that he takes into the field, a mason his trowel, a laborer his\nplow, in the same way. All nature is, in the opinion of religious\npeople, a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing beings, an\nimmense mass of complex volitions. In regard to all that takes place\noutside of us no conclusion is permissible that anything will result\nthus and so, must result thus and so, that we are comparatively\ncalculable and certain in our experiences, that man is the rule, nature\nthe ruleless. This view forms the fundamental conviction that dominates\ncrude, religion-producing, early civilizations. We contemporary men feel\nexactly the opposite: the richer man now feels himself inwardly, the\nmore polyphone the music and the sounding of his soul, the more\npowerfully does the uniformity of nature impress him. We all, with\nGoethe, recognize in nature the great means of repose for the soul. We\nlisten to the pendulum stroke of this great clock with longing for rest,\nfor absolute calm and quiescence, as if we could drink in the uniformity\nof nature and thereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself. Formerly\nit was the reverse: if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crude\ncivilization, or if we contemplate contemporary savages, we will find\nthem most strongly influenced by rule, by tradition. The individual is\nalmost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with the\nuniformity of a pendulum. To him nature—the uncomprehended, fearful,\nmysterious nature—must seem the domain of freedom, of volition, of\nhigher power, indeed as an ultra-human degree of destiny, as god. Every\nindividual in such periods and circumstances feels that his existence,\nhis happiness, the existence and happiness of the family, the state,\nthe success or failure of every undertaking, must depend upon these\ndispositions of nature. Certain natural events must occur at the proper\ntime and certain others must not occur. How can influence be exercised\nover this fearful unknown, how can this domain of freedom be brought\nunder subjection? thus he asks himself, thus he worries: Is there no\nmeans to render these powers of nature as subject to rule and tradition\nas you are yourself?—The cogitation of the superstitious and\nmagic-deluded man is upon the theme of imposing a law upon nature: and\nto put it briefly, religious worship is the result of such cogitation.\nThe problem which is present to every man is closely connected with this\none: how can the weaker party dictate laws to the stronger, control its\nacts in reference to the weaker? At first the most harmless form of\ninfluence is recollected, that influence which is acquired when the\npartiality of anyone has been won. Through beseeching and prayer,\nthrough abject humiliation, through obligations to regular gifts and\npropitiations, through flattering homages, it is possible, therefore, to\nimpose some guidance upon the forces of nature, to the extent that their\npartiality be won: love binds and is bound. Then agreements can be\nentered into by means of which certain courses of conduct are mutually\nconcluded, vows are made and authorities prescribed. But far more potent\nis that species of power exercised by means of magic and incantation. As\na man is able to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician and\nrender him helpless with fear, as the love potion operates at a\ndistance, so can the mighty forces of nature, in the opinion of weaker\nmankind, be controlled by similar means. The principal means of\neffecting incantations is to acquire control of something belonging to\nthe party to be influenced, hair, finger nails, food from his table,\neven his picture or his name. With such apparatus it is possible to act\nby means of magic, for the basic principle is that to everything\nspiritual corresponds something corporeal. With the aid of this\ncorporeal element the spirit may be bound, injured or destroyed. The\ncorporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold of.\nIn the same way that man influences mankind does he influences some\nspirit of nature, for this latter has also its corporeal element that\ncan be grasped. The tree, and on the same basis, the seed from which it\ngrew: this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in both forms the\nsame spirit is embodied, now large, now small. A stone that suddenly\nrolls, is the body in which the spirit works. Does a huge boulder lie in\na lonely moor? It is impossible to think of mortal power having placed\nit there. The stone must have moved itself there. That is to say some\nspirit must dominate it. Everything that has a body is subject to magic,\nincluding, therefore, the spirits of nature. If a god is directly\nconnected with his portrait, a direct influence (by refraining from\ndevout offerings, by whippings, chainings and the like) can be brought\nto bear upon him. The lower classes in China tie cords around the\npicture of their god in order to defy his departing favor, when he has\nleft them in the lurch, and tear the picture to pieces, drag it through\nthe streets into dung heaps and gutters, crying: “You dog of a spirit,\nwe housed you in a beautiful temple, we gilded you prettily, we fed you\nwell, we brought you offerings, and yet how ungrateful you are!” Similar\ndisplays of resentment have been made against pictures of the mother of\ngod and pictures of saints in Catholic countries during the present\ncentury when such pictures would not do their duty during times of\npestilence and drought.</p>\n<p>Through all these magical relationships to nature countless ceremonies\nare occasioned, and finally, when their complexity and confusion grow\ntoo great, pains are taken to systematize them, to arrange them so that\nthe favorable course of nature’s progress, namely the great yearly\ncircle of the seasons, may be brought about by a corresponding course of\nthe ceremonial progress. The aim of religious worship is to influence\nnature to human advantage, and hence to instil a subjection to law into\nher that originally she has not, whereas at present man desires to find\nout the subjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby.\nIn brief, the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magic\nbetween man and man, and the magician is older than the priest. But it\nrests equally upon other and higher ideas. It brings into prominence the\nsympathetic relation of man to man, the existence of benevolence,\ngratitude, prayer, of truces between enemies, of loans upon security, of\narrangements for the protection of property. Man, even in very inferior\ndegrees of civilization, does not stand in the presence of nature as a\nhelpless slave, he is not willy-nilly the absolute servant of nature. In\nthe Greek development of religion, especially in the relationship to the\nOlympian gods, it becomes possible to entertain the idea of an existence\nside by side of two castes, a higher, more powerful, and a lower, less\npowerful: but both are bound together in some way, on account of their\norigin and are one species. They need not be ashamed of one another.\nThis is the element of distinction in Greek religion.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/human-all-too-human/the-religious-life/at-the-contemplation-of-certain-ancient-sacrificial-proceedings/\">At the Contemplation of Certain Ancient Sacrificial Proceedings.</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Origin of Religious Worship."}]},{"type":"text","value":"—Let us transport ourselves back to the\ntimes in which religious life flourished most vigorously and we will\nfind a fundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share and\nwhich has resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once for\nall so far as we are concerned: this conviction has to do with nature\nand intercourse with her.
