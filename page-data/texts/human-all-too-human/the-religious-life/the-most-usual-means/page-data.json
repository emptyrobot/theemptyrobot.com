It is the master stroke of religions and metaphysics\nthat wish to make man out bad and sinful by nature, to render nature\nsuspicious in his eyes and to so make himself evil, for he learns to\nfeel himself evil when he cannot divest himself of nature. He gradually\ncomes to look upon himself, after a long life lived naturally, so\noppressed by a weight of sin that supernatural powers become necessary\nto relieve him of the burden; and with this notion comes the so called\nneed of salvation, which is the result not of a real but of an imaginary\nsinfulness.
