There, too, are various kinds of wondrous\nbirds, flying and sporting in the midst, and on the surface of the water\nthe four kinds of flowers, bright colored, giving out their floating\nscent; minstrel maidens cause their songs and chorded music, to invite\nthe prince. He, hearing the sounds of singing, sighs for the pleasures\nof the garden shades, and cherishing within these happy thoughts, he\ndwelt upon the joys of an outside excursion; even as the chained\nelephant ever longs for the free desert wilds.</p>\n<p>The royal father, hearing that the prince would enjoy to wander through\nthe gardens, first ordered all his attendant officers to adorn and\narrange them, after their several offices:—To make level and smooth the\nking’s highway, to remove from the path all offensive matter, all old\npersons, diseased or deformed, all those suffering through poverty or\ngreat grief, so that his son in his present humor might see nothing\nlikely to afflict his heart. The adornments being duly made, the prince\nwas invited to an audience; the king seeing his son approach, patted his\nhead, and looking at the color of his face, feelings of sorrow and joy\nintermingled, bound him. His mouth willing to speak, his heart\nrestrained.</p>\n<p>Now see the jewel-fronted gaudy chariot; the four equally pacing,\nstately horses; good-tempered and well trained; young and of graceful\nappearance; perfectly pure and white, and draped with flowery coverings.\nIn the same chariot stands the stately driver; the streets were\nscattered over with flowers; precious drapery fixed on either side of\nthe way, with dwarfed trees lining the road, costly vessels employed for\ndecoration, hanging canopies and variegated banners, silken curtains,\nmoved by the rustling breeze; spectators arranged on either side of the\npath. With bodies bent and glistening eyes, eagerly gazing, but not\nrudely staring, as the blue lotus flower they bent drooping in the air,\nministers and attendants flocking round him, as stars following the\nchief of the constellation; all uttering the same suppressed whisper of\nadmiration, at a sight so seldom seen in the world; rich and poor,\nhumble and exalted, old and young and middle-aged, all paid the greatest\nrespect, and invoked blessings on the occasion.</p>\n<p>So the country-folk and the town-folk, hearing that the prince was\ncoming forth, the well-to-do not waiting for their servants, those\nasleep and awake not mutually calling to one another, the six kinds of\ncreatures not gathered together and penned, the money not collected and\nlocked up, the doors and gates not fastened, all went pouring along the\nway on foot; the towers were filled, the mounds by the trees, the\nwindows and the terraces along the streets; with bent body fearing to\nlift their eyes, carefully seeing that there was nothing about them to\noffend, those seated on high addressing those seated on the ground,\nthose going on the road addressing those passing on high, the mind\nintent on one object alone; so that if a heavenly form had flown past,\nor a form entitled to highest respect, there would have been no\ndistraction visible, so intent was the body and so immovable the limbs.\nAnd now beautiful as the opening lily, he advances towards the garden\nglades, wishing to accomplish the words of the holy prophet (Rishi). The\nprince, seeing the ways prepared and watered and the joyous holiday\nappearance of the people; seeing too the drapery and chariot, pure,\nbright, shining, his heart exulted greatly and rejoiced. The people (on\ntheir part) gazed at the prince, so beautifully adorned, with all his\nretinue, like an assembled company of kings gathered to see a\nheaven-born prince. And now a Deva-râga of the Pure abode, suddenly\nappears by the side of the road; his form changed into that of an old\nman, struggling for life, his heart weak and oppressed. The prince\nseeing the old man, filled with apprehension, asked his charioteer,\n“What kind of man is this? his head white and his shoulders bent, his\neyes bleared and his body withered, holding a stick to support him along\nthe way. Is his body suddenly dried up by the heat, or has he been born\nin this way?” The charioteer, his heart much embarrassed, scarcely dared\nto answer truly, till the pure-born (Deva) added his spiritual power,\nand caused him to frame a reply in true words: “His appearance changed,\nhis vital powers decayed, filled with sorrow, with little pleasure, his\nspirits gone, his members nerveless, these are the indications of what\nis called ‘old age.’ This man was once a sucking child, brought up and\nnourished at his mother’s breast, and as a youth full of sportive life,\nhandsome, and in enjoyment of the five pleasures; as years passed on,\nhis frame decaying, he is brought now to the waste of age.”</p>\n<p>The prince, greatly agitated and moved, asked his charioteer another\nquestion and said, “Is yonder man the only one afflicted with age, or\nshall I, and others also, be such as he?” The charioteer again replied\nand said, “Your highness also inherits this lot: as time goes on, the\nform itself is changed, and this must doubtless come, beyond all\nhindrance. The youthful form must wear the garb of age, throughout the\nworld, this is the common lot.”</p>\n<p>Bodhisattva, who had long prepared the foundation of pure and spotless\nwisdom, broadly setting the root of every high quality, with a view to\ngather large fruit in his present life, hearing these words respecting\nthe sorrow of age, was afflicted in mind, and his hair stood upright.\nJust as the roll of the thunder and the storm alarm and put to flight\nthe cattle, so was Bodhisattva affected by the words; shaking with\napprehension, he deeply sighed; constrained at heart because of the pain\nof age; with shaking head and constant gaze, he thought upon this misery\nof decay; what joy or pleasure can men take, he thought, in that which\nsoon must wither, stricken by the marks of age; affecting all without\nexception; though gifted now with youth and strength, yet not one but\nsoon must change and pine away. The eye beholding such signs as these\nbefore it, how can it not be oppressed by a desire to escape?\nBodhisattva then addressed his charioteer: “Quickly turn your chariot\nand go back. Ever thinking on this subject of old age approaching, what\npleasures now can these gardens afford, the years of my life like the\nfast-flying wind; turn your chariot, and with speedy wheels take me to\nmy palace.” And so his heart keeping in the same sad tone, he was as one\nwho returns to a place of entombment; unaffected by any engagement or\nemployment, so he found no rest in anything within his home.</p>\n<p>The king hearing of his son’s sadness urged his companions to induce him\nagain to go abroad, and forthwith incited his ministers and attendants\nto decorate the gardens even more than before. The Deva then caused\nhimself to appear as a sick man; struggling for life, he stood by the\nwayside, his body swollen and disfigured, sighing with deep-drawn\ngroans; his hands and knees contracted and sore with disease, his tears\nflowing as he piteously muttered his petition. The prince asked his\ncharioteer, “What sort of man, again, is this?”</p>\n<p>Replying, he said, “This is a sick man. The four elements all confused\nand disordered, worn and feeble, with no remaining strength, bent down\nwith weakness, looking to his fellow-men for help.” The prince hearing\nthe words thus spoken, immediately became sad and depressed in heart,\nand asked, “Is this the only man afflicted thus, or are others liable to\nthe same calamity?” In reply he said, “Through all the world, men are\nsubject to the same condition; those who have bodies must endure\naffliction, the poor and ignorant, as well as the rich and great.” The\nprince, when these words met his ears, was oppressed with anxious\nthought and grief; his body and his mind were moved throughout, just as\nthe moon upon the ruffled tide. “Placed thus in the great furnace of\naffliction, say! what rest or quiet can there be! Alas! that worldly\nmen, blinded by ignorance and oppressed with dark delusion, though the\nrobber sickness may appear at any time, yet live with blithe and joyous\nhearts!” On this, turning his chariot back again, he grieved to think\nupon the pain of sickness. As a man beaten and wounded sore, with body\nweakened, leans upon his staff, so dwelt he in the seclusion of his\npalace, lone-seeking, hating worldly pleasures.</p>\n<p>The king, hearing once more of his son’s return, asked anxiously the\nreason why, and in reply was told—“he saw the pain of sickness.” The\nking, in fear, like one beside himself, roundly blamed the keepers of\nthe way; his heart constrained, his lips spoke not; again he increased\nthe crowd of music-women, the sounds of merriment twice louder than\naforetime, if by these sounds and sights the prince might be gratified;\nand indulging worldly feelings, might not hate his home. Night and day\nthe charm of melody increased, but his heart was still unmoved by it.\nThe king himself then went forth to observe everything successively, and\nto make the gardens even yet more attractive, selecting with care the\nattendant women, that they might excel in every point of personal\nbeauty; quick in wit and able to arrange matters well, fit to ensnare\nmen by their winning looks; he placed additional keepers along the\nking’s way, he strictly ordered every offensive sight to be removed, and\nearnestly exhorted the illustrious coachman, to look well and pick out\nthe road as he went. And now that Deva of the Pure abode, again caused\nthe appearance of a dead man; four persons carrying the corpse lifted it\non high, and appeared (to be going on) in front of Bodhisattva; the\nsurrounding people saw it not, but only Bodhisattva and the charioteer.\nOnce more he asked, “What is this they carry? with streamers and flowers\nof every choice description, whilst the followers are overwhelmed with\ngrief, tearing their hair and wailing piteously.” And now the gods\ninstructing the coachman, he replied and said, “This is a dead man: all\nhis powers of body destroyed, life departed; his heart without thought,\nhis intellect dispersed; his spirit gone, his form withered and decayed;\nstretched out as a dead log; family ties broken—all his friends who\nonce loved him, clad in white cerements, now no longer delighting to\nbehold him, remove him to lie in some hollow ditch tomb.” The prince\nhearing the name of Death, his heart constrained by painful thoughts, he\nasked, “Is this the only dead man, or does the world contain like\ninstances?” Replying thus he said, “All, everywhere, the same; he who\nbegins his life must end it likewise; the strong and lusty and the\nmiddle-aged, having a body, cannot but decay and die.” The prince was\nnow harassed and perplexed in mind; his body bent upon the chariot\nleaning-board, with bated breath and struggling accents, stammered thus,\n“Oh worldly men! how fatally deluded! beholding everywhere the body\nbrought to dust, yet everywhere the more carelessly living; the heart is\nneither lifeless wood nor stone, and yet it thinks not ‘all is\nvanishing!‘” Then turning, he directed his chariot to go back, and no\nlonger waste his time in wandering. How could he, whilst in fear of\ninstant death, go wandering here and there with lightened heart! The\ncharioteer remembering the king’s exhortation feared much nor dared go\nback; straightforward then he pressed his panting steeds, passed onward\nto the gardens, came to the groves and babbling streams of crystal\nwater, the pleasant trees, spread out with gaudy verdure, the noble\nliving things and varied beasts so wonderful, the flying creatures and\ntheir notes melodious; all charming and delightful to the eye and ear,\neven as the heavenly Nandavana.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/i/putting-away-desire/\">Putting Away Desire</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Without are pleasant garden glades, flowing fountains, pure refreshing\nlakes, with every kind of flower, and trees with fruit, arranged in\nrows, deep shade beneath.
