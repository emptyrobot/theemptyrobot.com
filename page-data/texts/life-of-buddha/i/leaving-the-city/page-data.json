And now within a little\ninterval, the prince again requested the king that he might go abroad.</p>\n<p>Once more the chariot and the well-paced horses were prepared, adorned\nwith precious substances and every gem; and then with all the nobles,\nhis associates, surrounding him, he left the city gates. Just as the\nfour kinds of flower, when the sun shines, open out their leaves, so was\nthe prince in all his spiritual splendor; effulgent in the beauty of his\nyouth-time. As he proceeded to the gardens from the city, the road was\nwell prepared, smooth, and wide, the trees were bright with flowers and\nfruit, his heart was joyous, and forgetful of its care.</p>\n<p>Now by the roadside, as he beheld the ploughmen, plodding along the\nfurrows, and the writhing worms, his heart again was moved with piteous\nfeeling, and anguish pierced his soul afresh; to see those laborers at\ntheir toil, struggling with painful work, their bodies bent, their hair\ndishevelled, the dripping sweat upon their faces, their persons fouled\nwith mud and dust; the ploughing oxen, too, bent by the yokes, their\nlolling tongues and gaping mouths. The nature of the prince, loving,\ncompassionate, his mind conceived most poignant sorrow, and nobly moved\nto sympathy, he groaned with pain; then stooping down he sat upon the\nground, and watched this painful scene of suffering; reflecting on the\nways of birth and death! “Alas! he cried, for all the world! how dark\nand ignorant, void of understanding!” And then to give his followers\nchance of rest, he bade them each repose where’er they list, whilst he\nbeneath the shadow of a Gambu tree, gracefully seated, gave himself to\nthought. He pondered on the fact of life and death, inconstancy, and\nendless progress to decay. His heart thus fixed without confusion, the\nfive senses covered and clouded over, lost in possession of\nenlightenment and insight, he entered on the first pure state of\necstasy. All low desire removed, most perfect peace ensued; and fully\nnow in Samâdhi he saw the misery and utter sorrow of the world; the ruin\nwrought by age, disease, and death; the great misery following on the\nbody’s death; and yet men not awakened to the truth! oppressed with\nothers’ suffering (age, disease, and death), this load of sorrow weighed\nhis mind. “I now will seek,” he said, “a noble law, unlike the worldly\nmethods known to men. I will oppose disease and age and death, and\nstrive against the mischief wrought by these on men.”</p>\n<p>Thus lost in tranquil contemplation, he considered that youth, vigor,\nand strength of life, constantly renewing themselves, without long stay,\nin the end fulfil the rule of ultimate destruction. Thus he pondered,\nwithout excessive joy or grief, without hesitation or confusion of\nthought, without dreaminess or extreme longing, without aversion or\ndiscontent, but perfectly at peace, with no hindrance, radiant with the\nbeams of increased illumination. At this time a Deva of the Pure abode,\ntransforming himself into the shape of a Bhikshu, came to the place\nwhere the prince was seated; the prince with due consideration rose to\nmeet him, and asked him who he was. In reply he said, “I am a Shâman,\ndepressed and sad at thought of age, disease, and death; I have left my\nhome to seek some way of rescue, but everywhere I find old age, disease,\nand death; all things hasten to decay and there is no permanency.\nTherefore I search for the happiness of something that decays not, that\nnever perishes, that never knows beginning, that looks with equal mind\non enemy and friend, that heeds not wealth nor beauty; the happiness of\none who finds repose alone in solitude, in some unfrequented dell, free\nfrom molestation, all thoughts about the world destroyed; dwelling in\nsome lonely hermitage, untouched by any worldly source of pollution,\nbegging for food sufficient for the body.” And forthwith as he stood\nbefore the prince, gradually rising up he disappeared in space.</p>\n<p>The prince, with joyful mind, considering, recollected former Buddhas,\nestablished thus in perfect dignity of manner; with noble mien and\npresence, as this visitor. Thus calling things to mind with perfect\nself-possession, he reached the thought of righteousness, and by what\nmeans it can be gained. Indulging thus for some time in thoughts of\nreligious solitude, he now suppressed his feelings and controlled his\nmembers, and rising turned again towards the city. His followers all\nflocked after him, calling him to stop and not go far from them, but in\nhis mind these secret thoughts so held him, devising means by which to\nescape from the world, that though his body moved along the road, his\nheart was far away among the mountains; even as the bound and captive\nelephant ever thinks about his desert wilds. The prince now entering the\ncity, there met him men and women, earnest for their several ends; the\nold besought him for their children, the young sought something for the\nwife, others sought something for their brethren; all those allied by\nkinship or by family, aimed to obtain their several suits, all of them\njoined in relationship dreading the pain of separation. And now the\nprince’s heart was filled with joy, as he suddenly heard those words\n“separation and association.” “These are joyful sounds to me,” he said,\n“they assure me that my vow shall be accomplished.” Then deeply\npondering the joy of “snapped relationship,” the idea of Nirvâna,\ndeepened and widened in him, his body as a peak of the Golden Mount, his\nshoulder like the elephant’s, his voice like the spring-thunder, his\ndeep-blue eye like that of the king of oxen; his mind full of religious\nthoughts, his face bright as the full moon, his step like that of the\nlion king, thus he entered his palace; even as the son of Lord Sakra, or\nSakra-putra, his mind reverential, his person dignified, he went\nstraight to his father’s presence, and with head inclined, inquired, “Is\nthe king well?” Then he explained his dread of age, disease, and death,\nand sought respectfully permission to become a hermit. “For all things\nin the world,” he said, “though now united, tend to separation.”\nTherefore he prayed to leave the world; desiring to find “true\ndeliverance.”</p>\n<p>His royal father hearing the words “leave the world,” was forthwith\nseized with great heart-trembling, even as the strong wild elephant\nshakes with his weight the boughs of some young sapling; going forward,\nseizing the prince’s hands, with falling tears, he spake as follows:\n“Stop! nor speak such words, the time is not yet come for ‘a religious\nlife;’ you are young and strong, your heart beats full, to lead a\nreligious life frequently involves trouble; it is rarely possible to\nhold the desires in check, the heart not yet estranged from their\nenjoyment; to leave your home and lead a painful ascetic life, your\nheart can hardly yet resolve on such a course. To dwell amidst the\ndesert wilds or lonely dells, this heart of yours would not be perfectly\nat rest, for though you love religious matters, you are not yet like me\nin years; you should undertake the kingdom’s government, and let me\nfirst adopt ascetic life; but to give up your father and your sacred\nduties, this is not to act religiously; you should suppress this thought\nof ‘leaving home,’ and undertake your worldly duties, find your delight\nin getting an illustrious name, and after this give up your home and\nfamily.”</p>\n<p>The prince, with proper reverence and respectful feelings, again\nbesought his royal father; but promised if he could be saved from four\ncalamities, that he would give up the thought of “leaving home.” If he\nwould grant him life without end, no disease, nor undesirable old age,\nand no decay of earthly possessions, then he would obey and give up the\nthought of “leaving home.”</p>\n<p>The royal father then addressed the prince, “Speak not such words as\nthese, for with respect to these four things, who is there able to\nprevent them, or say nay to their approach; asking such things as these,\nyou would provoke men’s laughter! But put away this thought of ‘leaving\nhome,’ and once more take yourself to pleasure.”</p>\n<p>The prince again besought his father, “If you may not grant me these\nfour prayers, then let me go I pray, and leave my home. O! place no\ndifficulties in my path; your son is dwelling in a burning house, would\nyou indeed prevent his leaving it! To solve a doubt is only reasonable,\nwho could forbid a man to seek its explanation? Or if he were forbidden,\nthen by self-destruction he might solve the difficulty, in an\nunrighteous way: and if he were to do so, who could restrain him after\ndeath?”</p>\n<p>The royal father, seeing his son’s mind so firmly fixed that it could\nnot be turned, and that it would be waste of strength to bandy further\nwords or arguments, forthwith commanded more attendant women, to provoke\nstill more his mind to pleasure; day and night he ordered them to keep\nthe roads and ways, to the end that he might not leave his palace. He\nmoreover ordered all the ministers of the country to come to the place\nwhere dwelt the prince, to quote and illustrate the rules of filial\npiety, hoping to cause him to obey the wishes of the king.</p>\n<p>The prince, beholding his royal father bathed with tears and o’erwhelmed\nwith grief, forthwith returned to his abode, and sat himself in silence\nto consider; all the women of the palace, coming towards him, waited as\nthey circled him, and gazed in silence on his beauteous form. They gazed\nupon him not with furtive glance, but like the deer in autumn brake\nlooks wistfully at the hunter; around the prince’s straight and handsome\nform, bright as the mountain of true gold (Sumeru). The dancing women\ngathered doubtingly, waiting to hear him bid them sound their music;\nrepressing every feeling of the heart through fear, even as the deer\nwithin the brake; now gradually the day began to wane, the prince still\nsitting in the evening light, his glory streaming forth in splendor, as\nthe sun lights up Mount Sumeru; thus seated on his jewelled couch,\nsurrounded by the fumes of sandal-wood, the dancing women took their\nplaces round; then sounded forth their heavenly music, even as Vaisaman\nproduces every kind of rare and heavenly sounds. The thoughts which\ndwelt within the prince’s mind entirely drove from him desire for music,\nand though the sounds filled all the place, they fell upon his ear\nunnoticed. At this time the Deva of the Pure abode, knowing the prince’s\ntime was come, the destined time for quitting home, suddenly assumed a\nform and came to earth, to make the shapes of all the women\nunattractive, so that they might create disgust, and no desire arise\nfrom thought of beauty. Their half-clad forms bent in ungainly\nattitudes, forgetful in their sleep, their bodies crooked or supine, the\ninstruments of music lying scattered in disorder; leaning and facing one\nanother, or with back to back, or like those beings thrown into the\nabyss, their jewelled necklets bound about like chains, their clothes\nand undergarments swathed around their persons; grasping their\ninstruments, stretched along the earth, even as those undergoing\npunishment at the hands of keepers, their garments in confusion, or like\nthe broken kani flower; or some with bodies leaning in sleep against the\nwall, in fashion like a hanging bow or horn, or with their hands holding\nto the window-frames, and looking like an outstretched corpse. Their\nmouths half opened or else gaping wide, the loathsome dribble trickling\nforth, their heads uncovered and in wild disorder, like some unreasoning\nmadman’s; the flower wreaths torn and hanging across their face, or\nslipping off the face upon the ground; others with body raised as if in\nfearful dread, just like the lonely desert bird; or others pillowed on\ntheir neighbor’s lap, their hands and feet entwined together, whilst\nothers smiled or knit their brows in turn; some with eyes closed and\nopen mouth, their bodies lying in wild disorder, stretched here and\nthere, like corpses thrown together. And now the prince seated, in his\nbeauty, looked with thought on all the waiting women; before, they had\nappeared exceeding lovely, their laughing words, their hearts so light\nand gay, their forms so plump and young, their looks so bright; but now,\nhow changed! so uninviting and repulsive. And such is woman’s\ndisposition! how can they, then, be ever dear, or closely trusted; such\nfalse appearances! and unreal pretences; they only madden and delude the\nminds of men.</p>\n<p>“And now,” he said, “I have awakened to the truth! Resolved am I to\nleave such false society.” At this time the Deva of the Pure abode\ndescended and approached, unfastening the doors. The prince, too, at\nthis time rose and walked along, amid the prostrate forms of all the\nwomen; with difficulty reaching the inner hall, he called to Kandaka, in\nthese words, “My mind is now athirst and longing for the draught of the\nfountain of sweet dew; saddle then my horse, and quickly bring it here.\nI wish to reach the deathless city; my heart is fixed beyond all change,\nresolved I am and bound by sacred oath; these women, once so charming\nand enticing, now behold I altogether loathsome; the gates, which were\nbefore fast-barred and locked, now stand free and open! these evidences\nof something supernatural, point to a climax of my life.”</p>\n<p>Then Kandaka stood reflecting inwardly, whether to obey or not the\nprince’s order, without informing his royal father of it, and so incur\nthe heaviest punishment.</p>\n<p>The Devas then gave spiritual strength; and unperceived the horse\nequipped came round, with even pace; a gallant steed, with all his\njewelled trappings for a rider; high-maned, with flowing tail,\nbroad-backed, short-haired and eared, with belly like the deer’s, head\nlike the king of parrots, wide forehead, round and claw-shaped nostrils,\nbreath like the dragon’s, with breast and shoulders square, true and\nsufficient marks of his high breed. The royal prince, stroking the\nhorse’s neck, and rubbing down his body, said, “My royal father ever\nrode on thee, and found thee brave in fight and fearless of the foe; now\nI desire to rely on thee alike! to carry me far off to the stream (ford)\nof endless life, to fight against and overcome the opposing force of\nmen, the men who associate in search of pleasure, the men who engage in\nthe search after wealth, the crowds who follow and flatter such persons;\nin opposing sorrow, friendly help is difficult to find, in seeking\nreligious truth there must be rare enlightenment, let us then be knit\ntogether thus as friends; then, at last, there will be rest from sorrow.\nBut now I wish to go abroad, to give deliverance from pain; now then,\nfor your own sake it is, and for the sake of all your kind, that you\nshould exert your strength, with noble pace, without lagging or\nweariness.” Having thus exhorted him, he bestrode his horse, and\ngrasping the reins proceeded forth; the man like the sun shining forth\nfrom his tabernacle, the horse like the white floating cloud, exerting\nhimself but without exciting haste, his breath concealed and without\nsnorting; four spirits (Devas) accompanying him, held up his feet,\nheedfully concealing his advance, silently and without noise; the heavy\ngates fastened and barred, the heavenly spirits of themselves caused to\nopen. Reverencing deeply the virtuous father, loving deeply the\nunequalled son, equally affected with love towards all the members of\nhis family these Devas took their place.</p>\n<p>Suppressing his feelings, but not extinguishing his memory, lightly he\nadvanced and proceeded beyond the city, pure and spotless as the lily\nflowers which spring from the mud; looking up with earnestness at his\nfather’s palace, he announced his purpose—unwitnessed and\nunwritten—“If I escape not birth, old age, and death, for evermore I\npass not thus along.” All the concourse of Devas, the space-filling\nNâgas and spirits followed joyfully and exclaimed, “Well! well!” in\nconfirmation of the true words he spoke. The Nâgas and the company of\nDevas acquired a condition of heart difficult to obtain, and each with\nhis own inherent light led on the way shedding forth their brightness.\nThus man and horse, both strong of heart, went onwards, lost to sight\nlike streaming stars, but ere the eastern quarter flashed with light,\nthey had advanced three yoganas.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/ii/the-return-of-kandaka/\">The Return of Kandaka</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And so the king increased the means for gratifying the appetite for\npleasure; both night and day the joys of music wore out the prince,\nopposed to pleasure; disgusted with them, he desired their absence, his\nmind was weaned from all such thoughts, he only thought of age, disease,\nand death; as the lion wounded by an arrow."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The king then sent his chief ministers, and the most distinguished of\nhis family, young in years and eminent for beauty, as well as for wisdom\nand dignity of manners, to accompany and rest with him, both night and\nday, in order to influence the prince’s mind.
