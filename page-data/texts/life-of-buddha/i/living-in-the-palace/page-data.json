From the midst of the pure\nsnowy mountains, a wild herd of white elephants, without noise, of\nthemselves, came; not curbed by any, self-subdued, every kind of colored\nhorse, in shape and quality surpassingly excellent, with sparkling\njewelled manes and flowing tails, came prancing round, as if with wings;\nthese too, born in the desert, came at the right time, of themselves.

All the temples of the gods and sacred\nshrines, the gardens, wells, and fountains, all these like things in\nheaven, produced of themselves, at the proper time, their several\nadornments. There was no famishing hunger, the soldiers’ weapons were at\nrest, all diseases disappeared; throughout the kingdom all the people\nwere bound close in family love and friendship; piously affectioned they\nindulged in mutual pleasures, there were no impure or polluting desires;\nthey sought their daily gain righteously, no covetous money-loving\nspirit prevailed, but with religious purpose they gave liberally; there\nwas no thought of any reward or return, but all practised the four rules\nof purity; and every hateful thought was suppressed and destroyed. Even\nas in days gone by, Manu râga begat a child called “Brilliancy of the\nSun,” on which there prevailed through the country great prosperity, and\nall wickedness came to an end; so now the king having begotten a royal\nprince, these marks of prosperity were seen; and because of such a\nconcourse of propitious signs, the child was named Siddhârtha.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> And\nnow his royal mother, the queen Mâyâ, beholding her son born under such\ncircumstances, beautiful as a child of heaven, adorned with every\nexcellent distinction, from excessive joy which could not be controlled\ndied, and was born in heaven. Then Pragâ-pati Gautami, beholding the\nprince, like an angel, with beauty seldom seen on earth, seeing him thus\nborn and now his mother dead, loved and nourished him as her own child;\nand the child regarded her as his mother.</p>\n<p>So as the light of the sun or the moon, little by little increases, the\nroyal child also increased each day in every mental excellency and\nbeauty of person; his body exhaled the perfume of priceless sandal-wood,\ndecorated with the famed Gambunada gold gems; divine medicines there\nwere to preserve him in health, glittering necklaces upon his person;\nthe members of tributary states, hearing that the king had an heir born\nto him, sent their presents and gifts of various kinds: oxen, sheep,\ndeer, horses, and chariots, precious vessels and elegant ornaments, fit\nto delight the heart of the prince; but though presented with such\npleasing trifles, the necklaces and other pretty ornaments, the mind of\nthe prince was unmoved, his bodily frame small indeed, but his heart\nestablished; his mind at rest within its own high purposes, was not to\nbe disturbed by glittering baubles.</p>\n<p>And now he was brought to learn the useful arts, when lo! once\ninstructed he surpassed his teachers. His father, the king, seeing his\nexceeding talent, and his deep purpose to have done with the world and\nits allurements, began to inquire as to the names of those in his tribe\nwho were renowned for elegance and refinement. Elegant and graceful, and\na lovely maiden, was she whom they called Yasodharâ; in every way\nfitting to become a consort for the prince, and to allure by pleasant\nwiles his heart. The prince with a mind so far removed from the world,\nwith qualities so distinguished, and with so charming an appearance,\nlike the elder son of Brahmadeva, Sanatkumâra (She-na Kiu-ma-lo); the\nvirtuous damsel, lovely and refined, gentle and subdued in manner;\nmajestic like the queen of heaven, constant ever, cheerful night and\nday, establishing the palace in purity and quiet, full of dignity and\nexceeding grace, like a lofty hill rising up in space; or as a white\nautumn cloud; warm or cool according to the season; choosing a proper\ndwelling according to the year, surrounded by a return of singing women,\nwho join their voices in harmonious heavenly concord, without any\njarring or unpleasant sound, exciting in the hearers forgetfulness of\nworldly cares. As the heavenly Gandharvas of themselves, in their\nbeauteous palaces, cause the singing women to raise heavenly strains,\nthe sounds of which and their beauty ravish both eyes and heart—so\nBodhisattva dwelt in his lofty palace, with music such as this. The\nking, his father, for the prince’s sake, dwelt purely in his palace,\npractising every virtue; delighting in the teaching of the true law, he\nput away from him every evil companion, that his heart might not be\npolluted by lust; regarding inordinate desire as poison, keeping his\npassion and his body in due control, destroying and repressing all\ntrivial thoughts; desiring to enjoy virtuous conversation, loving\ninstruction fit to subdue the hearts of men, aiming to accomplish the\nconversion of unbelievers; removing all schemes of opposition from\nwhatever source they came by the enlightening power of his doctrine,\naiming to save the entire world; thus he desired that the body of people\nshould obtain rest; even as we desire to give peace to our children, so\ndid he long to give rest to the world. He also attended to his religious\nduties, sacrificing by fire to all the spirits, with clasped hands\nadoring the moon, bathing his body in the waters of the Ganges;\ncleansing his heart in the waters of religion, performing his duties\nwith no private aim, but regarding his child and the people at large;\nloving righteous conversation, righteous words with loving aim; loving\nwords with no mixture of falsehood, true words imbued by love, and yet\nwithal so modest and self-distrustful, unable on that account to speak\nas confident of truth; loving to all, and yet not loving the world; with\nno thought of selfishness or covetous desire: aiming to restrain the\ntongue and in quietness to find rest from wordy contentions, not seeking\nin the multitude of religious duties to condone for a worldly principle\nin action, but aiming to benefit the world by a liberal and\nunostentatious charity; the heart without any contentious thought, but\nresolved by goodness to subdue the contentious; desiring to mortify the\npassions, and to destroy every enemy of virtue; not multiplying coarse\nor unseemly words, but exhorting to virtue in the use of courteous\nlanguage; full of sympathy and ready charity, pointing out and\npractising the way of mutual dependence; receiving and understanding the\nwisdom of spirits and Rishis; crushing and destroying every cruel and\nhateful thought. Thus his fame and virtue were widely renowned, and yet\nhimself finally (or, forever) separate from the ties of the world,\nshowing the ability of a master builder, laying a good foundation of\nvirtue, an example for all the earth; so a man’s heart composed and at\nrest, his limbs and all his members will also be at ease. And now the\nson of Suddhodana, and his virtuous wife Yasodharâ, as time went on,\ngrowing to full estate, their child Râhula was born; and then Suddhodana\nrâga considered thus: “My son, the prince, having a son born to him, the\naffairs of the empire will be handed down in succession, and there will\nbe no end to its righteous government; the prince having begotten a son,\nwill love his son as I love him, and no longer think about leaving his\nhome as an ascetic, but devote himself to the practice of virtue; I now\nhave found complete rest of heart, like one just born to heavenly joys.”</p>\n<p>Like as in the first days of the kalpa, Rishi-kings by the way in which\nthey walked, practising pure and spotless deeds, offered up religious\nofferings, without harm to living thing, and illustriously prepared an\nexcellent karma, so the king excelling in the excellence of purity in\nfamily and excellence of wealth, excelling in strength and every\nexhibition of prowess, reflected the glory of his name through the\nworld, as the sun sheds abroad his thousand rays. But now, being the\nking of men, or a king among men, he deemed it right to exhibit his\nson’s prowess, for the sake of his family and kin, to exhibit him; to\nincrease his family’s renown, his glory spread so high as even to obtain\nthe name of “God begotten;” and having partaken of these heavenly joys,\nenjoying the happiness of increased wisdom; understanding the truth by\nhis own righteousness, derived from previous hearing of the truth. Would\nthat this might lead my son, he prayed, to love his child and not\nforsake his home; the kings of all countries, whose sons have not yet\ngrown up, have prevented them exercising authority in the empire, in\norder to give their minds relaxation, and for this purpose have provided\nthem with worldly indulgences, so that they may perpetuate the royal\nseed; so now the king, having begotten a royal son, indulged him in\nevery sort of pleasure; desiring that he might enjoy these worldly\ndelights, and not wish to wander from his home in search of wisdom. In\nformer times the Bodhisattva kings, although their way (life) has been\nrestrained, have yet enjoyed the pleasures of the world, and when they\nhave begotten a son, then separating themselves from family ties, have\nafterwards entered the solitude of the mountains, to prepare themselves\nin the way of a silent recluse.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/i/disgust-at-sorrow/\">Disgust at Sorrow</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>This seems to mean that those who had not received benefit from the teaching of the four previous Buddhas, that even these were placable and well-disposed.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>The description here given of the peace and content prevailing in the world on the birth of Bodhisattva (and his name given to him in consequence) resembles the account of the golden age in classic authors.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And now in the household of Suddhodana râga, because of the birth of the\nroyal prince, his clansmen and younger brethren, with his ministers,\nwere all generously disposed, whilst elephants, horses and chariots, and\nthe wealth of the country, and precious vessels, daily increased and\nabounded, being produced wherever requisite; so, too, countless hidden\ntreasures came of themselves from the earth.
