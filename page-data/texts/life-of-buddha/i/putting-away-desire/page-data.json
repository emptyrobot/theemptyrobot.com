But all the women\nbeheld the prince, clouded in brow, and his god-like body not exhibiting\nits wonted signs of beauty; fair in bodily appearance, surpassingly\nlovely, all looked upwards as they gazed, as when we call upon the moon\nDeva to come; but all their subtle devices were ineffectual to move\nBodhisattva’s heart.</p>\n<p>At last commingling together they join and look astonished and in fear,\nsilent without a word. Then there was a Brahmaputra, whose name was\ncalled Udâyi (Yau-to-i). He, addressing the women, said, “Now all of\nyou, so graceful and fair, see if you cannot by your combined power hit\non some device; for beauty’s power is not forever. Still it holds the\nworld in bondage, by secret ways and lustful arts; but no such\nloveliness in all the world as yours, equal to that of heavenly nymphs;\nthe gods beholding it would leave their queens, spirits and Rishis would\nbe misled by it; why not then the prince, the son of an earthly king?\nwhy should not his feelings be aroused? This prince indeed, though he\nrestrains his heart and holds it fixed, pure-minded, with virtue\nuncontaminated, not to be overcome by power of women; yet of old there\nwas Sundarî (Su-to-li) able to destroy the great Rishi, and to lead him\nto indulge in love, and so degrade his boasted eminence; undergoing long\npenance, Gautama fell likewise by the arts of a heavenly queen;\nShing-kü, a Rishi putra, practising lustful indulgences according to\nfancy, was lost. The Brahman Rishi Visvâmitra (Pi-she-po), living\nreligiously for ten thousand years, deeply ensnared by a heavenly queen,\nin one day was completely shipwrecked in faith; thus those enticing\nwomen, by their power, overcame the Brahman ascetics; how much more may\nye, by your arts, overpower the resolves of the king’s son; strive\ntherefore after new devices, let not the king fail in a successor to the\nthrone; women, though naturally weak, are high and potent in the way of\nruling men. What may not their arts accomplish in promoting in men a\nlustful desire?” At this time all the attendant women, hearing\nthroughout the words of Udâyi, increasing their powers of pleasing, as\nthe quiet horse when touched by the whip, went into the presence of the\nroyal prince, and each one strove in the practice of every kind of art.\nThey joined in music and in smiling conversation, raising their\neyebrows, showing their white teeth, with ogling looks, glancing one at\nthe other, their light drapery exhibiting their white bodies, daintily\nmoving with mincing gait, acting the part of a bride as if coming\ngradually nearer, desiring to promote in him a feeling of love,\nremembering the words of the great king, “With dissolute form and\nslightly clad, forgetful of modesty and womanly reserve.” The prince\nwith resolute heart was silent and still, with unmoved face he sat; even\nas the great elephant-dragon, whilst the entire herd moves round him; so\nnothing could disturb or move his heart, dwelling in their midst as in a\nconfined room. Like the divine Sakra, around whom all the Devîs\nassemble, so was the prince as he dwelt in the gardens; the maidens\nencircling him thus; some arranging their dress, others washing their\nhands or feet, others perfuming their bodies with scent, others twining\nflowers for decoration, others making strings for jewelled necklets,\nothers rubbing or striking their bodies, others resting, or lying, one\nbeside the other; others, with head inclined, whispering secret words,\nothers engaged in common sports, others talking of amorous things,\nothers assuming lustful attitudes, striving thus to move his heart. But\nBodhisattva, peaceful and collected, firm as a rock, difficult to move,\nhearing all these women’s talk, unaffected either to joy or sorrow, was\ndriven still more to serious thought, sighing to witness such strange\nconduct, and beginning to understand the women’s design, by these means\nto disconcert his mind, not knowing that youthful beauty soon falls,\ndestroyed by old age and death, fading and perishing! This is the great\ndistress! What ignorance and delusion (he reflected) overshadow their\nminds: “Surely they ought to consider old age, disease, and death, and\nday and night stir themselves up to exertion, whilst this sharp\ndouble-edged sword hangs over the neck. What room for sport or laughter,\nbeholding those monsters, old age, disease, and death? A man who is\nunable to resort to this inward knowledge, what is he but a wooden or a\nplaster man, what heart-consideration in such a case! Like the double\ntree that appears in the desert, with leaves and fruit all perfect and\nripe, the first cut down and destroyed, the other unmoved by\napprehension, so it is in the case of the mass of men: they have no\nunderstanding either!”</p>\n<p>At this time Udâyi came to the place where the prince was, and observing\nhis silent and thoughtful mien, unmoved by any desire for indulgence, he\nforthwith addressed the prince, and said, “The Mahâraga, by his former\nappointment, has selected me to act as friend to his son; may I\ntherefore speak some friendly words? an enlightened friendship is of\nthree sorts: that which removes things unprofitable, promotes that which\nis real gain, and stands by a friend in adversity. I claim the name of\n‘enlightened friend,’ and would renounce all that is magisterial, but\nyet not speak lightly or with indifference. What then are the three\nsources of advantage? listen, and I will now utter true words, and prove\nmyself a true and sincere adviser. When the years are fresh and\nripening, beauty and pleasing qualities in bloom, not to give proper\nweight to woman’s influence, this is a weak man’s policy. It is right\nsometimes to be of a crafty mind, submitting to those little subterfuges\nwhich find a place in the heart’s undercurrents, and obeying what those\nthoughts suggest in way of pleasures to be got from dalliance: this is\nno wrong in woman’s eye! even if now the heart has no desire, yet it is\nfair to follow such devices; agreement is the joy of woman’s heart,\nacquiescence is the substance (the full) of true adornment; but if a man\nreject these overtures, he’s like a tree deprived of leaves and fruits;\nwhy then ought you to yield and acquiesce? that you may share in all\nthese things. Because in taking, there’s an end of trouble—no light and\nchangeful thoughts then worry us—for pleasure is the first and foremost\nthought of all, the gods themselves cannot dispense with it. Lord Sakra\nwas drawn by it to love the wife of Gautama the Rishi; so likewise the\nRishi Agastya, through a long period of discipline, practising\nausterities, from hankering after a heavenly queen (Devî), lost all\nreward of his religious endeavors, the Rishi Brihaspati, and Kandradeva\nputra; the Rishi Parâsara, and Kavañgara (Kia-pin-ke-lo). All these, out\nof many others, were overcome by woman’s love. How much more then, in\nyour case, should you partake in such pleasant joys; nor refuse, with\nwilful heart, to participate in the worldly delights, which your present\nstation, possessed of such advantages, offers you, in the presence of\nthese attendants.”</p>\n<p>At this time the royal prince, hearing the words of his friend Udâyi, so\nskilfully put, with such fine distinction, cleverly citing worldly\ninstances, answered thus to Udâyi: “Thank you for having spoken\nsincerely to me; let me likewise answer you in the same way, and let\nyour heart suspend its judgment whilst you listen:—It is not that I am\ncareless about beauty, or am ignorant of the power of human joys, but\nonly that I see on all the impress of change; therefore my heart is sad\nand heavy; if these things were sure of lasting, without the ills of\nage, disease, and death, then would I too take my fill of love; and to\nthe end find no disgust or sadness. If you will undertake to cause these\nwomen’s beauty not to change or wither in the future, then, though the\njoy of love may have its evil, still it might hold the mind in thraldom.\nTo know that other men grow old, sicken, and die, would be enough to rob\nsuch joys of satisfaction; yet how much more in their own case (knowing\nthis) would discontentment fill the mind; to know such pleasures hasten\nto decay, and their bodies likewise; if, notwithstanding this, men yield\nto the power of love, their case indeed is like the very beasts. And now\nyou cite the names of many Rishis, who practised lustful ways in life;\ntheir cases likewise cause me sorrow, for in that they did these things,\nthey perished. Again, you cite the name of that illustrious king, who\nfreely gratified his passions, but he, in like way, perished in the act;\nknow, then, that he was not a conqueror; with smooth words to conceal an\nintrigue, and to persuade one’s neighbor to consent, and by consenting\nto defile his mind; how can this be called a just device? It is but to\nseduce one with a hollow lie—such ways are not for me to practise; or,\nfor those who love the truth and honesty; for they are, forsooth,\nunrighteous ways, and such a disposition is hard to reverence; shaping\none’s conduct after one’s likings, liking this or that, and seeing no\nharm in it, what method of experience is this! A hollow compliance, and\na protesting heart, such method is not for me to follow; but this I\nknow, old age, disease, and death, these are the great afflictions which\naccumulate, and overwhelm me with their presence; on these I find no\nfriend to speak, alas! alas! Udâyi! these, after all, are the great\nconcerns; the pain of birth, old age, disease, and death; this grief is\nthat we have to fear; the eyes see all things falling to decay, and yet\nthe heart finds joy in following them; but I have little strength of\npurpose, or command; this heart of mine is feeble and distraught,\nreflecting thus on age, disease, and death. Distracted, as I never was\nbefore; sleepless by night and day, how can I then indulge in pleasure?\nOld age, disease, and death consuming me, their certainty beyond a\ndoubt, and still to have no heavy thoughts, in truth my heart would be a\nlog or stone.” Thus the prince, for Uda’s sake, used every kind of\nskilful argument, describing all the pains of pleasure; and not\nperceiving that the day declined. And now the waiting women all, with\nmusic and their various attractions, seeing that all were useless for\nthe end, with shame began to flock back to the city; the prince\nbeholding all the gardens, bereft of their gaudy ornaments, the women\nall returning home, the place becoming silent and deserted, felt with\ntwofold strength the thought of impermanence. With saddened mien going\nback, he entered his palace.</p>\n<p>The king, his father, hearing of the prince, his heart estranged from\nthoughts of pleasure, was greatly overcome with sorrow, and like a sword\nit pierced his heart. Forthwith assembling all his council, he sought of\nthem some means to gain his end; they all replied, “These sources of\ndesire are not enough to hold and captivate his heart.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/i/leaving-the-city/\">Leaving the City</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"On the prince entering the garden the women came around to pay him\ncourt; and to arouse in him thoughts frivolous; with ogling ways and\ndeep design, each one setting herself off to best advantage; or joining\ntogether in harmonious concert, clapping their hands, or moving their\nfeet in unison, or joining close, body to body, limb to limb; or\nindulging in smart repartees, and mutual smiles; or assuming a\nthoughtful saddened countenance, and so by sympathy to please the\nprince, and provoke in him a heart affected by love.
