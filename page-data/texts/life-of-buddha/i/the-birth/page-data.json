Joyously reverenced by all men, as the new\nmoon is welcomed by the world, the king indeed was like the heaven-ruler\nSakra, his queen like the divine Saki. Strong and calm of purpose as the\nearth, pure in mind as the water-lily, her name, figuratively assumed,\nMâyâ, she was in truth incapable of class-comparison. On her in likeness\nas the heavenly queen descended the spirit and entered her womb. A\nmother, but free from grief or pain, she was without any false or\nillusory mind. Disliking the clamorous ways of the world, she remembered\nthe excellent garden of Lumbini, a pleasant spot, a quiet forest\nretreat, with its trickling fountains, and blooming flowers and fruits.\nQuiet and peaceful, delighting in meditation, respectfully she asked the\nking for liberty to roam therein; the king, understanding her earnest\ndesire, was seized with a seldom-felt anxiety to grant her request. He\ncommanded his kinsfolk, within and without the palace, to repair with\nher to that garden shade; and now the queen Mâyâ knew that her time for\nchild-bearing was come. She rested calmly on a beautiful couch,\nsurrounded by a hundred thousand female attendants; it was the eighth\nday of the fourth moon, a season of serene and agreeable character.</p>\n<p>Whilst she thus religiously observed the rules of a pure discipline,\nBodhisattva was born from her right side, come to deliver the world,\nconstrained by great pity, without causing his mother pain or anguish.\nAs king Yu-liu was born from the thigh, as King Pi-t’au was born from\nthe hand, as King Man-to was born from the top of the head, as King\nKia-k’ha was born from the arm-pit, so also was Bodhisattva on the day\nof his birth produced from the right side; gradually emerging from the\nwomb, he shed in every direction the rays of his glory. As one born from\nrecumbent space, and not through the gates of life, through countless\nkalpas, practising virtue, self-conscious he came forth to life, without\nconfusion. Calm and collected, not falling headlong was he born,\ngloriously manifested, perfectly adorned, sparkling with light he came\nfrom the womb, as when the sun first rises from the East.</p>\n<p>Men indeed regarded his exceeding great glory, yet their sight remained\nuninjured: he allowed them to gaze, the brightness of his person\nconcealed for the time, as when we look upon the moon in the heavens.\nHis body, nevertheless, was effulgent with light, and like the sun which\neclipses the shining of the lamp, so the true gold-like beauty of\nBodhisattva shone forth, and was diffused everywhere.

On every hand the world was greatly shaken, as the wind\ndrives the tossing boat; so also the minutest atoms of sandal perfume,\nand the hidden sweetness of precious lilies floated on the air, and rose\nthrough space, and then commingling, came back to earth; so again the\ngarments of Devas descending from heaven touching the body, caused\ndelightful thrills of joy; the sun and moon with constant course\nredoubled the brilliancy of their light, whilst in the world the fire’s\ngleam of itself prevailed without the use of fuel.

All cruel\nand malevolent kinds of beings, together conceived a loving heart; all\ndiseases and afflictions among men without a cure applied, of themselves\nwere healed. The various cries and confused sounds of beasts were hushed\nand silence reigned; the stagnant water of the river-courses flowed\napace, whilst the polluted streams became clear and pure. No clouds\ngathered throughout the heavens, whilst angelic music, self caused, was\nheard around; the whole world of sentient creatures enjoyed peace and\nuniversal tranquillity.</p>\n<p>Just as when a country visited by desolation, suddenly obtains an\nenlightened ruler, so when Bodhisattva was born, he came to remove the\nsorrows of all living things.</p>\n<p>Mâra,<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> the heavenly monarch, alone was grieved and rejoiced not. The Royal Father (Suddhodana), beholding his son, strange and miraculous, as\nto his birth, though self-possessed and assured in his soul, was yet\nmoved with astonishment and his countenance changed, whilst he\nalternately weighed with himself the meaning of such an event, now\nrejoiced and now distressed.</p>\n<p>The queen-mother beholding her child, born thus contrary to laws of\nnature, her timorous woman’s heart was doubtful; her mind, through fear,\nswayed between extremes: Not distinguishing the happy from the sad\nportents, again and again she gave way to grief; and now the aged women\nof the world, in a confused way supplicating heavenly guidance, implored\nthe gods to whom their rites were paid, to bless the child; to cause\npeace to rest upon the royal child. Now there was at this time in the\ngrove, a certain soothsayer, a Brahman, of dignified mien and\nwide-spread renown, famed for his skill and scholarship: beholding the\nsigns, his heart rejoiced, and he exulted at the miraculous event.\nKnowing the king’s mind to be somewhat perplexed, he addressed him with\ntruth and earnestness: “Men born in the world, chiefly desire to have a\nson the most renowned; but now the king, like the moon when full, should\nfeel in himself a perfect joy, having begotten an unequalled son, (for\nby this the king) will become illustrious among his race; let then his\nheart be joyful and glad, banish all anxiety and doubt, the spiritual\nomens that are everywhere manifested indicate for your house and\ndominion a course of continued prosperity. The most excellently endowed\nchild now born will bring deliverance to the entire world: none but a\nheavenly teacher has a body such as this, golden-colored, gloriously\nresplendent. One endowed with such transcendent marks must reach the\nstate of Samyak-Sambodhi, or, if he be induced to engage in worldly\ndelights, then he must become a universal monarch; everywhere recognized\nas the ruler of the great earth, mighty in his righteous government, as\na monarch ruling the four empires, uniting under his sway all other\nrulers; as among all lesser lights, the sun’s brightness is by far the\nmost excellent. But if he seek a dwelling among the mountain forests,\nwith single heart searching for deliverance, having arrived at the\nperfection of true wisdom, he will become illustrious throughout the\nworld; for as Mount Sumeru is monarch among all mountains, or, as gold\nis chief among all precious things; or, as the ocean is supreme among\nall streams; or, as the moon is first among the stars; or, as the sun is\nbrightest of all luminaries, so Tathâgata, born in the world, is the\nmost eminent of men; his eyes clear and expanding, the lashes both above\nand below moving with the lid, the iris of the eye of a clear blue\ncolor, in shape like the moon when half full, such characteristics as\nthese, without contradiction, foreshadow the most excellent condition of\nperfect wisdom.”</p>\n<p>At this time the king addressed the twice-born,<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> “If it be as you\nsay, with respect to these miraculous signs, that they indicate such\nconsequences, then no such case has happened with former kings, nor down\nto our time has such a thing occurred.” The Brahman addressed the king\nthus, “Say not so; for it is not right; for with regard to renown and\nwisdom, personal celebrity, and worldly substance, these four things\nindeed are not to be considered according to precedent or subsequence;\nbut whatever is produced according to nature, such things are liable to\nthe law of cause and effect: but now whilst I recount some parallels let\nthe king attentively listen:—Bhrigu, Angira, these two of Rishi family,\nhaving passed many years apart from men, each begat an excellently\nendowed son; Brihaspati with Sukra, skilful in making royal treatises,\nnot derived from former families (or tribes); Sârasvata, the Rishi,\nwhose works have long disappeared, begat a son, Po-lo-sa, who compiled\nillustrious Sûtras and Shâstras; that which now we know and see, is not\ntherefore dependent on previous connection; Vyâsa, the Rishi, the author\nof numerous treatises, after his death had among his descendants Poh-mi\n(Vâlmîki), who extensively collected Gâthâ sections; Atri, the Rishi,\nnot understanding the sectional treatise on medicine, afterwards begat\nÂtreya, who was able to control diseases; the twice-born Rishi Kusi\n(Kusika), not occupied with heretical treatises, afterwards begat\nKia-ti-na-râga, who thoroughly understood heretical systems; the\nsugar-cane monarch, who began his line, could not restrain the tide of\nthe sea, but Sagara-râga, his descendant, who begat a thousand royal\nsons, he could control the tide of the great sea so that it should come\nno further. Ganaka, the Rishi, without a teacher acquired power of\nabstraction. All these, who obtained such renown, acquired powers of\nthemselves; those distinguished before, were afterwards forgotten; those\nbefore forgotten, became afterwards distinguished; kings like these and\ngod-like Rishis have no need of family inheritance, and therefore the\nworld need not regard those going before or following. So, mighty king!\nis it with you: you should experience true joy of heart, and because of\nthis joy should banish forever doubt or anxiety.” The king, hearing the\nwords of the seer, was glad, and offered him increased gifts.</p>\n<p>“Now have I begotten a valiant son,” he said, “who will establish a\nwheel authority, whilst I, when old and gray-headed, will go forth to\nlead a hermit’s life, so that my holy, king-like son may not give up the\nworld and wander through mountain forests.”</p>\n<p>And now near the spot within the garden, there was a Rishi, leading the\nlife of an ascetic; his name was Asita, wonderfully skilful in the\ninterpretation of signs; he approached the gate of the palace; the king\nbeholding him exclaimed, “This is none other but Brahmadeva, himself\nenduring penance from love of true religion, these two characteristics\nso plainly visible as marks of his austerities.” Then the king was much\nrejoiced; and forthwith he invited him within the palace, and with\nreverence set before him entertainment, whilst he, entering the inner\npalace, rejoiced only in prospect of seeing the royal child.</p>\n<p>Although surrounded by the crowd of court ladies, yet still he was as if\nin desert solitude; and now they place a preaching throne and pay him\nincreased honor and religious reverence, as Antideva râga reverenced the\npriest Vasishtha. Then the king, addressing the Rishi, said: “Most\nfortunate am I, great Rishi! that you have condescended to come here to\nreceive from me becoming gifts and reverence; I pray you therefore enter\non your exhortation.”</p>\n<p>Thus requested and invited, the Rishi felt unutterable joy, and said,\n“All hail, ever victorious monarch! possessed of all noble, virtuous\nqualities, loving to meet the desires of those who seek, nobly generous\nin honoring the true law, conspicuous as a race for wisdom and humanity,\nwith humble mind you pay me homage, as you are bound. Because of your\nrighteous deeds in former lives, now are manifested these excellent\nfruits; listen to me, then, whilst I declare the reason of the present\nmeeting. As I was coming on the sun’s way, I heard the Devas in space\ndeclare that the king had born to him a royal son, who would arrive at\nperfect intelligence; moreover I beheld such other portents, as have\nconstrained me now to seek your presence; desiring to see the Sâkya\nmonarch who will erect the standard of the true law.”</p>\n<p>The king, hearing the Rishi’s words, was fully assured; escaping from\nthe net of doubt, he ordered an attendant to bring the prince, to\nexhibit him to the Rishi. The Rishi, beholding the prince, the\nthousand-rayed wheel on the soles of his feet, the web-like filament\nbetween his fingers, between his eyebrows the white wool-like\nprominence, his complexion bright and lustrous; seeing these wonderful\nbirth-portents, the seer wept and sighed deeply.</p>\n<p>The king beholding the tears of the Rishi, thinking of his son, his soul\nwas overcome, and his breath fast held his swelling heart. Thus alarmed\nand ill at ease, unconsciously he arose from his seat, and bowing his\nhead at the Rishi’s feet, he addressed him in these words: “This son of\nmine, born thus wonderfully, beautiful in face, and surpassingly\ngraceful, little different from the gods in form, giving promise of\nsuperiority in the world, ah! why has he caused thee grief and pain?\nForbid it, that my son should die! or should be short-lived!—the\nthought creates in me grief and anxiety; that one athirst, within reach\nof the eternal draught,<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> should after all reject and lose it! sad\nindeed! Forbid it, he should lose his wealth and treasure! dead to his\nhouse! lost to his country! for he who has a prosperous son in life,\ngives pledge that his country’s weal is well secured; and then, coming\nto die, my heart will rest content, rejoicing in the thought of\noffspring surviving me; even as a man possessed of two eyes, one of\nwhich keeps watch, while the other sleeps; not like the frost-flower of\nautumn, which, though it seems to bloom, is not a reality. A man who,\nmidst his tribe and kindred, deeply loves a spotless son, at every\nproper time in recollection of it has joy; O! that you would cause me to\nrevive!”</p>\n<p>The Rishi, knowing the king-sire to be thus greatly afflicted at heart,\nimmediately addressed the Mahârâga: “Let not the king be for a moment\nanxious! the words I have spoken to the king, let him ponder these, and\nnot permit himself to doubt; the portents now are as they were before,\ncherish then no other thoughts! But recollecting I myself am old, on\nthat account I could not hold my tears; for now my end is coming on. But\nthis son of thine will rule the world, born for the sake of all that\nlives! this is indeed one difficult to meet with; he shall give up his\nroyal estate, escape from the domain of the five desires, with\nresolution and with diligence practise austerities, and then awakening,\ngrasp the truth. Then constantly, for the world’s sake (all living\nthings), destroying the impediments of ignorance and darkness, he shall\ngive to all enduring light, the brightness of the sun of perfect wisdom.\nAll flesh submerged in the sea of sorrow; all diseases collected as the\nbubbling froth; decay and age like the wild billows; death like the\nengulfing ocean; embarking lightly in the boat of wisdom he will save\nthe world from all these perils, by wisdom stemming back the flood. His\npure teaching like to the neighboring shore, the power of meditation,\nlike a cool lake, will be enough for all the unexpected birds; thus deep\nand full and wide is the great river of the true law; all creatures\nparched by the drought of lust may freely drink thereof, without stint;\nthose enchained in the domain of the five desires, those driven along by\nmany sorrows, and deceived amid the wilderness of birth and death, in\nignorance of the way of escape, for these Bodhisattva has been born in\nthe world, to open out a way of salvation. The fire of lust and\ncovetousness, burning with the fuel of the objects of sense, he has\ncaused the cloud of his mercy to rise, so that the rain of the law may\nextinguish them. The heavy gates of gloomy unbelief, fast kept by\ncovetousness and lust, within which are confined all living things, he\nopens and gives free deliverance. With the tweezers of his diamond\nwisdom he plucks out the opposing principles of lustful desire. In the\nself-twined meshes of folly and ignorance all flesh poor and in misery,\nhelplessly lying, the king of the law has come forth, to rescue these\nfrom bondage. Let not the king in respect of this his son encourage in\nhimself one thought of doubt or pain; but rather let him grieve on\naccount of the world, led captive by desire, opposed to truth; but I,\nindeed, amid the ruins of old age and death, am far removed from the\nmeritorious condition of the holy one, possessed indeed of powers of\nabstraction, yet not within reach of the gain he will give, to be\nderived from his teaching as the Bodhisattva; not permitted to hear his\nrighteous law, my body worn out, after death, alas! destined to be born\nas a Deva<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> still liable to the three calamities, old age, decay, and\ndeath, therefore I weep.”</p>\n<p>The king and all his household attendants, hearing the words of the\nRishi, knowing the cause of his regretful sorrow, banished from their\nminds all further anxiety: “And now,” the king said, “to have begotten\nthis excellent son, gives me rest at heart; but that he should leave his\nkingdom and home, and practise the life of an ascetic, not anxious to\nensure the stability of the kingdom, the thought of this still brings\nwith it pain.”</p>\n<p>At this time the Rishi, turning to the king with true words, said, “It\nmust be even as the king anticipates, he will surely arrive at perfect\nenlightenment.” Thus having appeased every anxious heart among the\nking’s household, the Rishi by his own inherent spiritual power ascended\ninto space and disappeared.</p>\n<p>At this time Suddhodana râga, seeing the excellent marks (predictive\nsigns) of his son, and, moreover, hearing the words of Asita, certifying\nthat which would surely happen, was greatly affected with reverence to\nthe child: he redoubled measures for its protection, and was filled with\nconstant thought; moreover, he issued decrees through the empire, to\nliberate all captives in prison, according to the custom when a royal\nson was born, giving the usual largess, in agreement with the directions\nof the Sacred Books, and extending his gifts to all; or, all these\nthings he did completely. When the child was ten days old, his father’s\nmind being now quite tranquil, he announced a sacrifice to all the gods,\nand prepared to give liberal offerings to all the religious bodies;\nSrâmanas and Brahmanas invoked by their prayers a blessing from the\ngods, whilst he bestowed gifts on the royal kinspeople and the ministers\nand the poor within the country; the women who dwelt in the city or the\nvillages, all those who needed cattle or horses or elephants or money,\neach, according to his necessities, was liberally supplied. Then,\nselecting by divination a lucky time, they took the child back to his\nown palace, with a double-feeding white-pure-tooth, carried in a\nrichly-adorned chariot (cradle), with ornaments of every kind and color\nround his neck; shining with beauty, exceedingly resplendent with\nunguents. The queen embracing him in her arms, going around, worshipped\nthe heavenly spirits. Afterwards she remounted her precious chariot,\nsurrounded by her waiting women; the king, with his ministers and\npeople, and all the crowd of attendants, leading the way and following,\neven as the ruler of heaven, Sakra, is surrounded by crowds of Devas; as\nMahesvara, when suddenly his six-faced child was born; arranging every\nkind of present, gave gifts, and asked for blessings; so now the king,\nwhen his royal son was born, made all his arrangements in like manner.\nSo Vaisravana, the heavenly king, when Nalakûvara was born, surrounded\nby a concourse of Devas, was filled with joy and much gladness; so the\nking, now the royal prince was born, in the kingdom of Kapila, his\npeople and all his subjects were likewise filled with joy.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/i/living-in-the-palace/\">Living in the Palace</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Mâra, the king of the world of desire.
