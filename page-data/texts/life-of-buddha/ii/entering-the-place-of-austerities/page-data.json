As the lion, the king of beasts, when\nhe enters among the herd of beasts, drives from their minds all thoughts\nof common things, as now they watch the true form of their kind, so\nthose Rishi masters assembled there, suddenly perceiving the miraculous\nportent, were struck with awe and fearful gladness, as they gazed with\nearnest eyes and hands conjoined. The men and women, engaged in various\noccupations, beholding him, with unchanged attitudes, gazed as the gods\nlook on King Sakra, with constant look and eyes unmoved; so the Rishis,\nwith their feet fixed fast, looked at him even thus; whatever in their\nhands they held, without releasing it, they stopped and looked; even as\nthe ox when yoked to the wain, his body bound, his mind also restrained;\nso also the followers of the holy Rishis, each called the other to\nbehold the miracle. The peacocks and the other birds with cries\ncommingled flapped their wings; the Brahmakârins holding the rules of\ndeer, following the deer wandering through mountain glades, as the deer\ncoarse of nature, with flashing eyes, regard the prince with fixed gaze;\nso following the deer, those Brahmakârins intently gaze likewise,\nlooking at the exceeding glory of the Ikshvâku. As the glory of the\nrising sun is able to affect the herds of milch kine, so as to increase\nthe quantity of their sweet-scented milk, so those Brahmakârins, with\nwondrous joy, thus spoke one to the other: “Surely this is one of the\neight Vasu Devas”; others, “this is one of the two Asvins”; others,\n“this is Mâra”; others, “this is one of the Brahmakâyikas”; others,\n“this is Sûryadeva or Kandradeva, coming down; are they not seeking here\na sacrifice which is their due? Come let us haste to offer our religious\nservices!”</p>\n<p>The prince, on his part, with respectful mien addressed to them polite\nsalutation. Then Bodhisattva, looking with care in every direction on\nthe Brahmakârins occupying the wood, each engaged in his religious\nduties, all desirous of the delights of heaven, addressed the senior\nBrahmakârin, and asked him as to the path of true religion. “Now having\njust come here, I do not yet know the rules of your religious life. I\nask you therefore for information, and I pray explain to me what I ask.”</p>\n<p>On this that twice-born (Brahman) in reply explained in succession all\nthe modes of painful discipline, and the fruits expected as their\nresult. How some ate nothing brought from inhabited places but that\nproduced from pure water, others edible roots and tender twigs, others\nfruits and flowers fit for food, each according to the rules of his\nsect, clothing and food in each case different; some living amongst\nbird-kind, and like them capturing and eating food; others eating as the\ndeer the grass and herbs; others living like serpents, inhaling air;\nothers eating nothing pounded in wood or stone; some eating with two\nteeth, till a wound be formed; others, again, begging their food and\ngiving it in charity, taking only the remnants for themselves; others,\nagain, who let water continually drip on their heads and those who offer\nup with fire; others who practise water-dwelling like fish; thus there\nare Brahmakârins of every sort, who practise austerities, that they may\nat the end of life obtain a birth in heaven, and by their present\nsufferings afterwards obtain peaceable fruit.</p>\n<p>The lord of men, the excellent master, hearing all their modes of\nsorrow-producing penance, not perceiving any element of truth in them,\nexperienced no joyful emotion in his heart; lost in thought, he regarded\nthe men with pity, and with his heart in agreement his mouth thus spake:\n“Pitiful indeed are such sufferings! and merely in quest of a human or\nheavenly reward, ever revolving in the cycle of birth or death, how\ngreat your sufferings, how small the recompense! Leaving your friends,\ngiving up honorable position; with a firm purpose to obtain the joys of\nheaven, although you may escape little sorrows, yet in the end involved\nin great sorrow; promoting the destruction of your outward form, and\nundergoing every kind of painful penance, and yet seeking to obtain\nanother birth; increasing and prolonging the causes of the five desires,\nnot considering that herefrom birth and death, undergoing suffering and,\nby that, seeking further suffering; thus it is that the world of men,\nthough dreading the approach of death, yet strive after renewed birth;\nand being thus born, they must die again. Although still dreading the\npower of suffering, yet prolonging their stay in the sea of pain.\nDisliking from their heart their present kind of life, yet still\nstriving incessantly after other life; enduring affliction that they may\npartake of joy; seeking a birth in heaven, to suffer further trouble;\nseeking joys, whilst the heart sinks with feebleness. For this is so\nwith those who oppose right reason; they cannot but be cramped and poor\nat heart. But by earnestness and diligence, then we conquer. Walking in\nthe path of true wisdom, letting go both extremes, we then reach\nultimate perfection; to mortify the body, if this is religion, then to\nenjoy rest, is something not resulting from religion. To walk\nreligiously and afterwards to receive happiness, this is to make the\nfruit of religion something different from religion; but bodily exercise\nis but the cause of death, strength results alone from the mind’s\nintention; if you remove from conduct the purpose of the mind, the\nbodily act is but as rotten wood; wherefore, regulate the mind, and then\nthe body will spontaneously go right. You say that to eat pure things is\na cause of religious merit, but the wild beasts and the children of\npoverty ever feed on these fruits and medicinal herbs; these then ought\nto gain much religious merit. But if you say that the heart being good\nthen bodily suffering is the cause of further merit, then I ask why may\nnot those who live in ease, also possess a virtuous heart? If joys are\nopposed to a virtuous heart, a virtuous heart may also be opposed to\nbodily suffering; if, for instance, all those heretics profess purity\nbecause they use water in various ways, then those who thus use water\namong men, even with a wicked mind, yet ought ever to be pure. But if\nrighteousness is the groundwork of a Rishi’s purity, then the idea of a\nsacred spot as his dwelling, being the cause of his righteousness is\nwrong. What is reverenced, should be known and seen. Reverence indeed is\ndue to righteous conduct, but let it not redound to the place or mode of\nlife.”</p>\n<p>Thus speaking at large on religious questions, they went on till the\nsetting sun. He then beheld their rites in connection with sacrifice to\nfire, the drilling for sparks and the fanning into flame, also the\nsprinkling of the butter libations, also the chanting of the mystic\nprayers, till the sun went down. The prince considering these acts,\ncould not perceive the right reason of them, and was now desirous to\nturn and go. Then all those Brahmakârins came together to him to request\nhim to stay; regarding with reverence the dignity of Bodhisattva, very\ndesirous, they earnestly besought him: “You have come from an\nirreligious place, to this wood where true religion flourishes, and yet,\nnow, you wish to go away; we beg you, then, on this account, to stay.”\nAll the old Brahmakârins, with their twisted hair and bark clothes, came\nfollowing after Bodhisattva, asking him as a god to stay a little while.\nBodhisattva seeing these aged ones following him, their bodies worn with\nmacerations, stood still and rested beneath a tree; and soothing them,\nurged them to return. Then all the Brahmakârins, young and old,\nsurrounding him, made their request with joined hands: “You who have so\nunexpectedly arrived here, amid these garden glades so full of\nattraction, why now are you leaving them and going away, to seek\nperfection in the wilderness? As a man loving long life, is unwilling to\nlet go his body, so we are even thus; would that you would stop awhile.\nThis is a spot where Brahmans and Rishis have ever dwelt, royal Rishis\nand heavenly Rishis, these all have dwelt within these woods. The places\non the borders of the snowy mountains, where men of high birth undergo\ntheir penance, those places are not to be compared to this. All the body\nof learned masters from this place have reached heaven; all the learned\nRishis who have sought religious merit, have from this place and\nnorthwards found it; those who have attained a knowledge of the true\nlaw, and gained divine wisdom come not from southwards; if you indeed\nsee us remiss and not earnest enough, practising rules not pure, and on\nthat account are not pleased to stay, then we are the ones that ought to\ngo; you can still remain and dwell here; all these different\nBrahmakârins ever desire to find companions in their penances. And you,\nbecause you are conspicuous for your religious earnestness, should not\nso quickly cast away their society: if you can remain here, they will\nhonor you as god Sakra, yea! as the Devas pay worship to Brihaspati.”</p>\n<p>Then Bodhisattva answered the Brahmakârins and told them what his\ndesires were: “I am seeking for a true method of escape, I desire solely\nto destroy all mundane influences; but you, with strong hearts, practise\nyour rules as ascetics, and pay respectful attention to such visitors as\nmay come. My heart indeed is moved with affection towards you, for\npleasant conversation is agreeable to all, those who listen are affected\nthereby; and so hearing your words, my mind is strengthened in religious\nfeeling; you indeed have all paid me much respect, in agreement with the\ncourtesy of your religious profession; but now I am constrained to\ndepart, my heart grieves thereat exceedingly: first of all, having left\nmy own kindred, and now about to be separated from you. The pain of\nseparation from associates, this pain is as great as the other; it is\nimpossible for my mind not to grieve, as it is not to see others’\nfaults. But you, by suffering pain, desire earnestly to obtain the joys\nof birth in heaven; whilst I desire to escape from the three worlds, and\ntherefore I give up what my reason tells me must be rejected. The law\nwhich you practise, you inherit from the deeds of former teachers, but\nI, desiring to destroy all combination, seek a law which admits of no\nsuch accident. And, therefore, I cannot in this grove delay for a longer\nwhile in fruitless discussions.”</p>\n<p>At this time all the Brahmakârins, hearing the words spoken by\nBodhisattva, words full of right reason and truth, very excellent in the\ndistinction of principles, their hearts rejoiced and exulted greatly,\nand deep feelings of reverence were excited within them.</p>\n<p>At this time there was one Brahmakârin, who always slept in the dust,\nwith tangled hair and raiment of the bark of trees, his eyes bleared,\npreparing himself in an ascetic practice called “high-nose.”<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> This\none addressed Bodhisattva in the following words: “Strong in will!\nbright in wisdom! firmly fixed in resolve to escape the limits of birth,\nknowing that in escape from birth there alone is rest, not affected by\nany desire after heavenly blessedness, the mind set upon the eternal\ndestruction of the bodily form, you are indeed miraculous in appearance,\nas you are alone in the possession of such a mind. To sacrifice to the\ngods, and to practise every kind of austerity, all this is designed to\nsecure a birth in heaven, but here there is no mortification of selfish\ndesire, there is still a selfish personal aim; but to bend the will to\nseek final escape, this is indeed the work of a true teacher, this is\nthe aim of an enlightened master; this place is no right halting-place\nfor you; you ought to proceed to Mount Pinda: there dwells a great Muni,\nwhose name is A-lo-lam. He only has reached the end of religious aims,\nthe most excellent eye of the law. Go, therefore, to the place where he\ndwells, and listen there to the true exposition of the law. This will\nmake your heart rejoice, as you learn to follow the precepts of his\nsystem. As for me, beholding the joy of your resolve, and fearing that I\nshall not obtain rest, I must once more let go those following me, and\nseek other disciples; straighten my head and gaze with my full eyes;\nanoint my lips and cleanse my teeth; cover my shoulders and make bright\nmy face, smooth my tongue and make it pliable. Thus, O excellently\nmarked sir! fully drinking at the fountain of the water you give, I\nshall escape from the unfathomable depths. In the world nought is\ncomparable to this, that which old men and Rishis have not known, that\nshall I know and obtain.”</p>\n<p>Bodhisattva having listened to these words, left the company of the\nRishis, whilst they all, turning round him to the right, returned to\ntheir place.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/ii/the-general-grief-of-the-palace/\">The General Grief of the Palace</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>That is, raising his nose to look up at the sun.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The prince having dismissed Kandaka, as he entered the Rishis’ abode,\nhis graceful body brightly shining, lit up on every side the forest\n“place of suffering”; himself gifted with every excellence, according to\nhis gifts, so were they reflected.
