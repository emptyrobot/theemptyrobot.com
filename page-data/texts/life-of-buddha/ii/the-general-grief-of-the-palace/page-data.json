First of\nall with the royal prince, passing along the road for one night, but now\ndismissed and ordered to return. As the darkness of night closed on him,\nirresolute he wavered in mind. On the eighth day approaching the city,\nthe noble horse pressed onwards, exhibiting all his qualities of speed;\nbut yet hesitating as he looked around and beheld not the form of the\nroyal prince; his four members bent down with toil, his head and neck\ndeprived of their glossy look, whinnying as he went on with grief, he\nrefused night and day his grass and water, because he had lost his lord,\nthe deliverer of men. Returning thus to Kapilavastu, the whole country\nappeared withered and bare, as when one comes back to a deserted\nvillage; or as when the sun hidden behind Sumeru causes darkness to\nspread over the world. The fountains of water sparkled no more, the\nflowers and fruits were withered and dead, the men and women in the\nstreets seemed lost in grief and dismay. Thus Kandaka with the white\nhorse went on sadly and with slow advance, silent to those inquiring,\nwearily progressing as when accompanying a funeral; so they went on,\nwhilst all the spectators seeing Kandaka, but not observing the royal\nSâkya prince, raised piteous cries of lamentation and wept; as when the\ncharioteer returned without Râma.</p>\n<p>Then one by the side of the road, with his body bent, called out to\nKandaka: “The prince, beloved of the world, the defender of his people,\nthe one you have taken away by stealth, where dwells he now?” Kandaka,\nthen, with sorrowful heart, replied to the people and said: “I with\nloving purpose followed after him whom I loved; ‘tis not I who have\ndeserted the prince, but by him have I been sent away; by him who now\nhas given up his ordinary adornments, and with shaven head and religious\ngarb, has entered the sorrow-giving grove.”</p>\n<p>Then the men hearing that he had become an ascetic, were oppressed with\nthoughts of wondrous boding; they sighed with heaviness and wept, and as\ntheir tears coursed down their cheeks, they spake thus one to the other:\n“What then shall we do?” Then they all exclaimed at once, “Let us haste\nafter him in pursuit; for as when a man’s bodily functions fail, his\nframe dies and his spirit flees, so is the prince our life, and he our\nlife gone, how shall we survive? This city, perfected with slopes and\nwoods; those woods, that cover the slopes of the city, all deprived of\ngrace, ye lie as Bharata when killed!”</p>\n<p>Then the men and women within the town, vainly supposing the prince had\ncome back, in haste rushed out to the heads of the way, and seeing the\nhorse returning alone, not knowing whether the prince was safe or lost,\nbegan to weep and to raise every piteous sound; and said, “Behold!\nKandaka advancing slowly with the horse, comes back with sighs and\ntears; surely he grieves because the prince is lost.” And thus sorrow is\nadded to sorrow!</p>\n<p>Then like a captive warrior is drawn before the king his master, so did\nhe enter the gates with tears, his eyes filled so that he said nought.\nThen looking up to heaven he loudly groaned; and the white horse too\nwhined piteously; then all the varied birds and beasts in the palace\ncourt, and all the horses within the stables, hearing the sad whinnying\nof the royal steed, replied in answer to him, thinking “now the prince\nhas come back.” But seeing him not, they ceased their cries!</p>\n<p>And now the women of the after-palace, hearing the cries of the horses,\nbirds, and beasts, their hair dishevelled, their faces wan and yellow,\ntheir forms sickly to look at, their mouths and lips parched, their\ngarments torn and unwashed, the soil and heat not cleansed from their\nbodies, their ornaments all thrown aside, disconsolate and sad,\ncheerless in face, raised their bodies, without any grace, even as the\nfeeble little morning star; their garments torn and knotted, soiled like\nthe appearance of a robber, seeing Kandaka and the royal horse shedding\ntears instead of the hoped-for return, they all, assembled thus, uttered\ntheir cry, even as those who weep for one beloved just dead. Confused\nand wildly they rushed about, as a herd of oxen that have lost their\nway.</p>\n<p>Mahâpragâpati Gotamî, hearing that the prince had not returned, fell\nfainting on the ground, her limbs entirely deprived of strength, even as\nsome mad tornado wind crushes the golden-colored plantain tree; and\nagain, hearing that her son had become a recluse, deeply sighing and\nwith increased sadness she thought, “Alas! those glossy locks turning to\nthe right, each hair produced from each orifice, dark and pure,\ngracefully shining, sweeping the earth when loose,<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> or when so\ndetermined, bound together in a heavenly crown, and now shorn and lying\nin the grass! Those rounded shoulders and that lion step! Those eyes\nbroad as the ox-king’s, that body shining bright as yellow gold; that\nsquare breast and Brahma voice; that you! possessing all these excellent\nqualities, should have entered on the sorrow-giving forest; what fortune\nnow remains for the world, losing thus the holy king of earth? That\nthose delicate and pliant feet, pure as the lily and of the same color,\nshould now be torn by stones and thorns; O how can such feet tread on\nsuch ground! Born and nourished in the guarded palace, clad with\ngarments of the finest texture, washed in richly scented water, anointed\nwith the choicest perfumes, and now exposed to chilling blasts and dews\nof night, O! where during the heat or the chilly morn can rest be found!\nThou flower of all thy race! Confessed by all the most renowned! Thy\nvirtuous qualities everywhere talked of and exalted, ever reverenced,\nwithout self-seeking! why hast thou unexpectedly brought thyself upon\nsome morn to beg thy food for life! Thou who wert wont to repose upon a\nsoft and kingly couch, and indulge in every pleasure during thy waking\nhours: how canst thou endure the mountain and the forest wilds, on the\nbare grass to make thyself a resting-place!”</p>\n<p>Thus thinking of her son—her heart was full of sorrow, disconsolate she\nlay upon the earth. The waiting women raised her up, and dried the tears\nfrom off her face, whilst all the other courtly ladies, overpowered with\ngrief, their limbs relaxed, their minds bound fast with woe, unmoved\nthey sat like pictured-folk.</p>\n<p>And now Yasodharâ, deeply chiding, spoke thus to Kandaka: “Where now\ndwells he, who ever dwells within my mind? You two went forth, the horse\na third, but now two only have returned! My heart is utterly o’erborne\nwith grief, filled with anxious thoughts, it cannot rest. And you,\ndeceitful man! Untrustworthy and false associate! evil contriver!\nplainly revealed a traitor, a smile lurks underneath thy tears!\nEscorting him in going; returning now with wails! Not one at heart—but\nin league against him—openly constituted a friend and well-wisher,\nconcealing underneath a treacherous purpose; so thou hast caused the\nsacred prince to go forth once and not return again! No questioning the\njoy you feel! Having done ill you now enjoy the fruit; better far to\ndwell with an enemy of wisdom, than work with one who, while a fool,\nprofesses friendship. Openly professing sweetness and light, inwardly a\nscheming and destructive enemy. And now this royal and kingly house, in\none short morn is crushed and ruined! All these fair and queen-like\nwomen, with grief o’erwhelmed, their beauty marred, their breathing\nchoked with tears and sobs, their faces soiled with crossing tracks of\ngrief! Even the queen (Mâyâ) when in life, resting herself on him, as\nthe great snowy mountains repose upon the widening earth, through grief\nin thought of what would happen, died. How sad the lot of these—within\nthese open lattices—these weeping ones, these deeply wailing! Born in\nanother state than hers in heaven, how can their grief be borne!” Then\nspeaking to the horse she said, “Thou unjust! what dulness this—to\ncarry off a man, as in the darkness some wicked thief bears off a\nprecious gem. When riding thee in time of battle, swords, and javelins\nand arrows, none of these alarmed or frighted thee! But now what\nfitfulness of temper this, to carry off by violence, to rob my soul of\none, the choicest jewel of his tribe. O! thou art but a vicious reptile,\nto do such wickedness as this! to-day thy woeful lamentation sounds\neverywhere within these palace walls, but when you stole away my\ncherished one, why wert thou dumb and silent then! if then thy voice had\nsounded loud, and roused the palace inmates from their sleep, if then\nthey had awoke and slumbered not, there would not have ensued the\npresent sorrow.”</p>\n<p>Kandaka, hearing these sorrowful words, drawing in his breath and\ncomposing himself, wiping away his tears, with hands clasped together,\nanswered: “Listen to me, I pray, in self-justification—be not\nsuspicious of, nor blame the royal horse, nor be thou angry with me,\neither. For in truth no fault has been committed by us. It is the gods\nwho have effected this. For I, indeed, extremely reverenced the king’s\ncommand, it was the gods who drove him to the solitudes, urgently\nleading on the horse with him: thus they went together fleet as with\nwings, his breathing hushed! suppressed was every sound, his feet scarce\ntouched the earth! The city gates wide opening of themselves! all space\nself-lighted! this was the work indeed of the gods; and what was I, or\nwhat my strength, compared with theirs?”</p>\n<p>Yasodharâ hearing these words, her heart was lost in deep consideration!\nthe deeds accomplished by the gods could not be laid to others’ charge,\nas faults; and so she ceased her angry chiding, and allowed her great\nconsuming grief to smoulder. Thus prostrate on the ground she muttered\nout her sad complaints, “That the two doves should be divided! Now,” she\ncried, “my stay and my support is lost, between those once agreed in\nlife, separation has sprung up! those who were at one as to religion are\nnow divided! where shall I seek another mode of life? In olden days the\nformer conquerors greatly rejoiced to see their kingly retinue; these\nwith their wives in company, in search of highest wisdom, roamed through\ngroves and plains. And now, that he should have deserted me! and what is\nthe religious state he seeks! the Brahman ritual respecting sacrifice,\nrequires the wife to take part in the offering, and because they both\nshare in the service they shall both receive a common reward hereafter!\nbut you O prince! art niggard in your religious rites, driving me away,\nand wandering forth alone! Is it that you saw me jealous, and so turned\nagainst me! that you now seek someone free from jealousy! or did you see\nsome other cause to hate me, that you now seek to find a heaven-born\nnymph! But why should one excelling in every personal grace seek to\npractise self-denying austerities! is it that you despise a common lot\nwith me, that variance rises in your breast against your wife! Why does\nnot Râhula fondly repose upon your knee. Alas! alas! unlucky master!\nfull of grace without, but hard at heart! The glory and the pride of all\nyour tribe, yet hating those who reverence you! O! can it be, you have\nturned your back for good upon your little child, scarce able yet to\nsmile! My heart is gone! and all my strength! my lord has fled, to\nwander in the mountains! he cannot surely thus forget me! he is then but\na man of wood or stone.” Thus having spoken, her mind was dulled and\ndarkened, she muttered on, or spoke in wild mad words, or fancied that\nshe saw strange sights, and sobbing past the power of self-restraint,\nher breath grew less, and sinking thus, she fell asleep upon the dusty\nground! The palace ladies seeing this, were wrung with heartfelt sorrow,\njust as the full-blown lily, struck by the wind and hail, is broken down\nand withered.</p>\n<p>And now the king, his father, having lost the prince, was filled, both\nnight and day, with grief; and fasting, sought the gods for help. He\nprayed that they would soon restore him, and having prayed and finished\nsacrifice, he went from out the sacred gates; then hearing all the cries\nand sounds of mourning, his mind distressed became confused, as when\nheaven’s thundering and lightning put to bewildering flight a herd of\nelephants. Then seeing Kandaka with the royal steed, after long\nquestioning, finding his son a hermit, fainting he fell upon the earth,\nas when the flag of Indra falls and breaks. Then all the ministers of\nstate, upraising him, exhort him, as was right, to calm himself. After\nawhile, his mind somewhat recovered, speaking to the royal steed, he\nsaid: “How often have I ridden thee to battle, and every time have\nthought upon your excellence! but now I hate and loathe thee, more than\never I have loved or praised thee! My son, renowned for noble qualities,\nthou hast carried off and taken from me; and left him ‘mid the mountain\nforests; and now you have come back alone; take me, then, quickly hence\nand go! And going, never more come back with me! For since you have not\nbrought him back, my life is worth no more preserving; no longer care I\nabout governing! My son about me was my only joy; as the Brahman Gayanta\nmet death for his son’s sake, so I, deprived of my religious son, will\nof myself deprive myself of life. So Manu, lord of all that lives, ever\nlamented for his son; how much more I, a mortal man deprived of mine,\nmust lose all rest! In old time the king Aga, loving his son, wandering\nthrough the mountains, lost in thought, ended life, and forthwith was\nborn in heaven. And now I cannot die! Through the long night fixed in\nthis sad state, with this great palace round me, thinking of my son,\nsolitary and athirst as any hungry spirit; as one who, thirsty, holding\nwater in his hand, but when he tries to drink lets all escape, and so\nremains athirst till death ensues, and after death becomes a wandering\nghost; so I, in the extremity of thirst, through loss, possessed once of\na son, but now without a son, still live and cannot end my days! But\ncome! tell me at once where is my son! let me not die athirst for want\nof knowing this and fall among the Pretas. In former days, at least, my\nwill was strong and firm, difficult to move as the great earth; but now\nI’ve lost my son, my mind is dazed, as was in old time the king\nDasaratha’s.”</p>\n<p>And now the royal teacher (Purohita), an illustrious sage, with the\nchief minister, famed for wisdom, with earnest and considerate minds,\nboth exhorted with remonstrances, the king. “Pray you (they said) arouse\nyourself to thought, and let not grief cramp and hold your mind! in\nolden days there were mighty kings, who left their country, as flowers\nare scattered; your son now practises the way of wisdom; why then nurse\nyour grief and misery; you should recall the prophecy of Asita, and\nreasonably count on what was probable! Think of the heavenly joys which\nyou, a universal king, have inherited! But now, so troubled and\nconstrained in mind, how will it not be said, ‘The Lord of earth can\nchange his golden-jewel-heart!’ Now, therefore, send us forth, and bid\nus seek the place he occupies, then by some stratagem and strong\nremonstrances, and showing him our earnestness of purpose, we will break\ndown his resolution, and thus assuage your kingly sorrow.”</p>\n<p>The king, with joy, replied and said: “Would that you both would go in\nhaste, as swiftly as the Saketa bird flies through the void for her\nyoung’s sake; thinking of nought but the royal prince, and sad at\nheart—I shall await your search!”</p>\n<p>The two men having received their orders, the king retired among his\nkinsfolk, his heart somewhat more tranquillized, and breathing freely\nthrough his throat.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/ii/the-mission-to-seek-the-prince/\">The Mission to Seek the Prince</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>This description of the prince’s hair seems to contradict the head arrangement of the figures of Buddha, unless the curls denote the shaven head of the recluse.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Kandaka leading back the horse, opening the way for his heart’s sorrow,\nas he went on, lamented and wept: unable to disburden his soul.

In old time the king Aga, loving his son, wandering\nthrough the mountains, lost in thought, ended life, and forthwith was\nborn in heaven. And now I cannot die! Through the long night fixed in\nthis sad state, with this great palace round me, thinking of my son,\nsolitary and athirst as any hungry spirit; as one who, thirsty, holding\nwater in his hand, but when he tries to drink lets all escape, and so\nremains athirst till death ensues, and after death becomes a wandering\nghost; so I, in the extremity of thirst, through loss, possessed once of\na son, but now without a son, still live and cannot end my days! But\ncome! tell me at once where is my son! let me not die athirst for want\nof knowing this and fall among the Pretas. In former days, at least, my\nwill was strong and firm, difficult to move as the great earth; but now\nI’ve lost my son, my mind is dazed, as was in old time the king\nDasaratha’s.”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And now the royal teacher (Purohita), an illustrious sage, with the\nchief minister, famed for wisdom, with earnest and considerate minds,\nboth exhorted with remonstrances, the king. “Pray you (they said) arouse\nyourself to thought, and let not grief cramp and hold your mind! in\nolden days there were mighty kings, who left their country, as flowers\nare scattered; your son now practises the way of wisdom; why then nurse\nyour grief and misery; you should recall the prophecy of Asita, and\nreasonably count on what was probable!
