They, on their part, begged them to be seated, and\nrepeated the law for their peace and comfort.</p>\n<p>Then forthwith they addressed the Rishis and said: “We have on our minds\na subject on which we would ask for advice. There is one who is called\nSuddhodana râga, a descendant of the famous Ikshvâku family, we are his\nteacher and his minister, who instruct him in the sacred books as\nrequired. The king indeed is like Indra for dignity; his son, like\nKe-yan-to, in order to escape old age, disease, and death, has become a\nhermit, and depends on this; on his account have we come hither, with a\nview to let your worships know of this.”</p>\n<p>Replying, they said: “With respect to this youth, has he long arms and\nthe signs of a great man? Surely he is the one who, inquiring into our\npractice, discoursed so freely on the matter of life and death. He has\ngone to the abode of Arâda, to seek for a complete mode of escape.”</p>\n<p>Having received this certain information, respectfully considering the\nurgent commands of the anxious king, they dared not hesitate in their\nundertaking, but straightway took the road and hastened on. Then seeing\nthe wood in which the royal prince dwelt, and him, deprived of all\noutward marks of dignity, his body still glorious with lustrous shining,\nas when the sun comes forth from the black cloud; then the religious\nteacher of the country and the great minister holding to the true law,\nput off from them their courtly dress, and descending from the chariot\ngradually advanced, like the royal Po-ma-ti and the Rishi Vasishtha,\nwent through the woods and forests, and seeing the royal prince Râma,\neach according to his own prescribed manner, paid him reverence, as he\nadvanced to salute him; or as Sukra, in company with Angiras, with\nearnest heart paid reverence, and sacrificed to Indra râga.</p>\n<p>Then the royal prince in return paid reverence to the royal teacher and\nthe great minister, as the divine Indra placed at their ease Sukra and\nAngiras; then, at his command, the two men seated themselves before the\nprince, as Pou-na and Pushya, the twin stars attend beside the moon;\nthen the Purohita and the great minister respectfully explained to the\nroyal prince, even as Pi-li-po-ti spoke to that Gayanta: “Your royal\nfather, thinking of the prince, is pierced in heart, as with an iron\npoint; his mind distracted, raves in solitude; he sleeps upon the dusty\nground; by night and day he adds to his sorrowful reflections; his tears\nflow down like the incessant rain; and now to seek you out, he has sent\nus hither. Would that you would listen with attentive mind; we know that\nyou delight to act religiously; it is certain, then, without a doubt,\nthis is not the time for you to enter the forest wilds; a feeling of\ndeep pity consumes our heart! You, if you be indeed moved by religion,\nought to feel some pity for our case; let your kindly feelings flow\nabroad, to comfort us who are worn at heart; let not the tide of sorrow\nand of sadness completely overwhelm the outlets of our heart; as the\ntorrents which roll down the grassy mountains; or the calamities of\ntempest, fiery heat, and lightning; for so the grieving heart has these\nfour sorrows, turmoil and drought, passion and overthrow. But come!\nreturn to your native place, the time will arrive when you can go forth\nagain as a recluse. But now to disregard your family duties, to turn\nagainst father and mother, how can this be called love and affection?\nthat love which overshadows and embraces all. Religion requires not the\nwild solitudes; you can practise a hermit’s duties in your home;\nstudiously thoughtful, diligent in expedients, this is to lead a\nhermit’s life in truth. A shaven head, and garments soiled with dirt—to\nwander by yourself through desert wilds—this is but to encourage\nconstant fears, and cannot be rightly called ‘an awakened hermit’s\nlife.’ Would rather we might take you by the hand, and sprinkle water on\nyour head, and crown you with a heavenly diadem, and place you\nunderneath a flowery canopy, that all eyes might gaze with eagerness\nupon you; after this, in truth, we would leave our home with joy. The\nformer kings, Teou-lau-ma, A-neou-ke-o-sa, Po-ke-lo-po-yau,\nPi-po-lo-‘anti, Pi-ti-o-ke-na, Na-lo-sha-po-lo, all these several kings\nrefused not the royal crown, the jewels, and the ornaments of person;\ntheir hands and feet were adorned with gems, around them were women to\ndelight and please, these things they cast not from them, for the sake\nof escape; you then may also come back home, and undertake both\nnecessary duties; your mind prepare itself in higher law, whilst for the\nsake of earth you wield the sceptre; let there be no more weeping, but\ncomply with what we say, and let us publish it; and having published it\nwith your authority, then you may return and receive respectful welcome.\nYour father and your mother, for your sake, in grief shed tears like the\ngreat ocean; having no stay and no dependence now—no source from which\nthe Sâkya stem may grow—you ought, like the captain of the ship, to\nbring it safely across to a place of safety. The royal prince Pi-san-ma,\nas also Lo-me-po-ti, they respectfully attended to the command of their\nfather: you also should do the same! Your loving mother who cherished\nyou so kindly, with no regard for self, through years of care, as the\ncow deprived of her calf, weeps and laments, forgetting to eat or sleep;\nyou surely ought to return to her at once, to protect her life from\nevil; as a solitary bird, away from its fellows, or as the lonely\nelephant, wandering through the jungle, losing the care of their young,\never think of protecting and defending them, so you the only child,\nyoung and defenceless, not knowing what you do, bring trouble and\nsolicitude; cause, then, this sorrow to dissipate itself; as one who\nrescues the moon from being devoured, so do you reassure the men and\nwomen of the land, and remove from them the consuming grief, and\nsuppress the sighs that rise like breath to heaven, which cause the\ndarkness that obscures their sight; seeking you, as water, to quench the\nfire; the fire quenched, their eyes shall open.”</p>\n<p>Bodhisattva, hearing of his father the king, experienced the greatest\ndistress of mind, and sitting still, gave himself to reflection; and\nthen, in due course, replied respectfully: “I know indeed that my royal\nfather is possessed of a loving and deeply considerate mind, but my fear\nof birth, old age, disease, and death, has led me to disobey, and\ndisregard his extreme kindness. Whoever neglects right consideration\nabout his present life, and because he hopes to escape in the end,\ntherefore disregards all precautions in the present: on this man comes\nthe inevitable doom of death. It is the knowledge of this, therefore,\nthat weighs with me, and after long delay has constrained me to a\nhermit’s life; hearing of my father, the king, and his grief, my heart\nis affected with increased love; but yet, all is like the fancy of a\ndream, quickly reverting to nothingness. Know then, without fear of\ncontradiction, that the nature of existing things is not uniform; the\ncause of sorrow is not necessarily the relationship of child with\nparent, but that which produces the pain of separation, results from the\ninfluence of delusion; as men going along a road suddenly meet midway\nwith others, and then a moment more are separated, each one going his\nown way, so by the force of concomitance, relationships are framed, and\nthen, according to each one’s destiny, there is separation; he who\nthoroughly investigates this false connection of relationship ought not\nto cherish in himself grief; in this world there is rupture of family\nlove, in another life it is sought for again; brought together for a\nmoment, again rudely divided, everywhere the fetters of kindred are\nformed! Ever being bound, and ever being loosened! who can sufficiently\nlament such constant separations; born into the world, and then\ngradually changing, constantly separated by death and then born again.\nAll things which exist in time must perish; the forests and mountains,\nall things that exist; in time are born all sensuous things, so is it\nboth with worldly substance and with time. Because, then, death pervades\nall time, get rid of death, and time will disappear. You desire to make\nme king, and it is difficult to resist the offices of love; but as a\ndisease is difficult to bear without medicine, so neither can I bear\nthis weight of dignity; in every condition, high or low, we find folly\nand ignorance, and men carelessly following the dictates of lustful\npassion; at last, we come to live in constant fear; thinking anxiously\nof the outward form, the spirit droops; following the ways of men, the\nmind resists the right; but, the conduct of the wise is not so. The\nsumptuously ornamented and splendid palace I look upon as filled with\nfire; the hundred dainty dishes of the divine kitchen, as mingled with\ndestructive poisons; the lily growing on the tranquil lake, in its midst\nharbors countless noisome insects; and so the towering abode of the rich\nis the house of calamity; the wise will not dwell therein. In former\ntimes illustrious kings, seeing the many crimes of their home and\ncountry, affecting as with poison the dwellers therein, in sorrowful\ndisgust sought comfort in seclusion; we know, therefore, that the\ntroubles of a royal estate are not to be compared with the repose of a\nreligious life; far better dwell in the wild mountains, and eat the\nherbs like the beasts of the field; therefore I dare not dwell in the\nwide palace, for the black snake has its dwelling there. I reject the\nkingly estate and the five desires; to escape such sorrows I wander\nthrough the mountain wilds. This, then, would be the consequence of\ncompliance: that I, who, delighting in religion, am gradually getting\nwisdom, should now quit these quiet woods, and returning home, partake\nof sensual pleasures, and thus by night and day increase my store of\nmisery. Surely this is not what should be done! that the great leader of\nan illustrious tribe, having left his home from love of religion, and\nforever turned his back upon tribal honor, desiring to confirm his\npurpose as a leader—that he—discarding outward form, clad in religious\ngarb, loving religious meditation, wandering through the wilds—should\nnow reject his hermit vestment, tread down his sense of proper shame and\ngive up his aim. This, though I gained heaven’s kingly state, cannot be\ndone! how much less to gain an earthly, though distinguished, home!</p>\n<p>“For having spewed forth lust, passion, and ignorance, shall I return to\nfeed upon it? as a man might go back to his vomit! such misery, how\ncould I bear? Like a man whose house has caught fire, by some expedient\nfinds a way to escape, will such a man forthwith go back and enter it\nagain? such conduct would disgrace a man! So I, beholding the evils,\nbirth, old age, and death, to escape the misery, have become a hermit;\nshall I then go back and enter in, and like a fool dwell in their\ncompany? He who enjoys a royal estate and yet seeks rescue, cannot dwell\nthus, this is no place for him; escape is born from quietness and rest;\nto be a king is to add distress and poison; to seek for rest and yet\naspire to royal condition are but contradictions; royalty and rescue,\nmotion and rest, like fire and water, having two principles, cannot be\nunited. So one resolved to seek escape cannot abide possessed of kingly\ndignity! And if you say a man may be a king, and at the same time\nprepare deliverance for himself, there is no certainty in this! to seek\ncertain escape is not to risk it thus; it is through this uncertain\nframe of mind that once a man gone forth is led to go back home again;\nbut I, my mind is not uncertain; severing the baited hook of\nrelationship, with straightforward purpose, I have left my home. Then\ntell me, why should I return again?”</p>\n<p>The great minister, inwardly reflecting, thought, “The mind of the royal\nprince, my master, is full of wisdom, and agreeable to virtue, what he\nsays is reasonable and fitly framed.” Then he addressed the prince and\nsaid: “According to what your highness states, he who seeks religion\nmust seek it rightly; but this is not the fitting time for you; your\nroyal father, old and of declining years, thinking of you his son, adds\ngrief to grief; you say indeed, ‘I find my joy in rescue. To go back\nwould be apostasy.’ But yet your joy denotes unwisdom, and argues want\nof deep reflection; you do not see, because you seek the fruit, how vain\nto give up present duty. There are some who say, There is ‘hereafter’;\nothers there are who say, ‘Nothing hereafter.’ So whilst this question\nhangs in suspense, why should a man give up his present pleasure? If\nperchance there is ‘hereafter,’ we ought to bear patiently what it\nbrings; if you say, ‘Hereafter is not,’ then there is not either\nsalvation! If you say, ‘Hereafter is,’ you would not say, ‘Salvation\ncauses it.’ As earth is hard, or fire is hot, or water moist, or wind is\nmobile, ‘Hereafter’ is just so. It has its own distinct nature. So when\nwe speak of pure and impure, each comes from its own distinctive nature.\nIf you should say, ‘By some contrivance this can be removed,’ such an\nopinion argues folly. Every root within the moral world has its own\nnature predetermined; loving remembrance and forgetfulness, these have\ntheir nature fixed and positive; so likewise age, disease, and death,\nthese sorrows, who can escape by strategy? If you say, ‘Water can put\nout fire,’ or ‘Fire can cause water to boil and pass away,’ then this\nproves only that distinctive natures may be mutually destructive; but\nnature in harmony produces living things; so man when first conceived\nwithin the womb, his hands, his feet, and all his separate members, his\nspirit and his understanding, of themselves are perfected; but who is he\nwho does it? Who is he that points the prickly thorn? This too is\nnature, self-controlling. And take again the different kinds of beasts,\nthese are what they are, without desire on their part; and so, again,\nthe heaven-born beings, whom the self-existent (Isvara) rules, and all\nthe world of his creation; these have no self-possessed power of\nexpedients; for if they had a means of causing birth, there would be\nalso means for controlling death, and then what need of\nself-contrivance, or seeking for deliverance? There are those who say,\n‘I’ (the soul) is the cause of birth, and others who affirm, ‘I’ (the\nsoul) is the cause of death. There are some who say, ‘Birth comes from\nnothingness, and without any plan of ours we perish.’ Thus one is born a\nfortunate child, removed from poverty, of noble family, or learned in\ntestamentary lore of Rishis, or called to offer mighty sacrifices to the\ngods, born in either state, untouched by poverty, then their famous name\nbecomes to them ‘escape,’ their virtues handed down by name to us; yet\nif these attained their happiness, without contrivance of their own, how\nvain and fruitless is the toil of those who seek ‘escape.’ And you,\ndesirous of deliverance, purpose to practise some high expedient, whilst\nyour royal father frets and sighs; for a short while you have essayed\nthe road, and leaving home have wandered through the wilds, to return\nthen would not now be wrong; of old, King Ambarisha for a long while\ndwelt in the grievous forest, leaving his retinue and all his kinsfolk,\nbut afterwards returned and took the royal office; and so Râma, son of\nthe king of the country, leaving his country occupied the mountains, but\nhearing he was acting contrary to usage, returned and governed\nrighteously. And so the king of Sha-lo-po, called To-lo-ma, father and\nson, both wandered forth as hermits, but in the end came back again\ntogether; so Po-‘sz-tsau Muni, with On-tai-tieh, in the wild mountains\npractising as Brahmakârins, these too returned to their own country.\nThus all these worthies of a by-gone age, famous for their advance in\ntrue religion, came back home and royally governed, as lamps\nenlightening the world. Wherefore for you to leave the mountain wilds,\nreligiously to rule, is not a crime.”</p>\n<p>The royal prince, listening to the great minister’s loving words without\nexcess of speaking, full of sound argument, clear and unconfused, with\nno desire to wrangle after the way of the schools, with fixed purpose,\ndeliberately speaking, thus answered the great minister: “The question\nof being and not being is an idle one, only adding to the uncertainty of\nan unstable mind, and to talk of such matters I have no strong\ninclination; purity of life, wisdom, the practice of asceticism, these\nare matters to which I earnestly apply myself, the world is full of\nempty studies which our teachers in their office skilfully involve; but\nthey are without any true principle, and I will none of them! The\nenlightened man distinguishes truth from falsehood; but how can truth be\nborn from such as those? For they are like the man born blind, leading\nthe blind man as a guide; as in the night, as in thick darkness both\nwander on, what recovery is there for them? Regarding the question of\nthe pure and impure, the world involved in self-engendered doubt cannot\nperceive the truth; better to walk along the way of purity, or rather\nfollow the pure law of self-denial, hate the practice of impurity,\nreflect on what was said of old, not obstinate in one belief or one\ntradition, with sincere mind accepting all true words, and ever\nbanishing sinful sorrow (i.e. sin, the cause of grief). Words which\nexceed sincerity are vainly spoken; the wise man uses not such words. As\nto what you say of Râma and the rest, leaving their home, practising a\npure life, and then returning to their country, and once more mixing\nthemselves in sensual pleasures, such men as these walk vainly; those\nwho are wise place no dependence on them. Now, for your sakes, permit\nme, briefly, to recount this one true principle of action: The sun, the\nmoon may fall to earth, Sumeru and all the snowy mountains overturn, but\nI will never change my purpose; rather than enter a forbidden place, let\nme be cast into the fierce fire; not to accomplish rightly what I have\nentered on, and to return once more to my own land, there to enter the\nfire of the five desires, let it befall me as my own oath records.” So\nspake the prince, his arguments as pointed as the brightness of the\nperfect sun; then rising up he passed some distance off.</p>\n<p>The Purohita and the minister, their words and discourse prevailing\nnothing, conversed together, after which, resolving to depart on their\nreturn, with great respect they quietly inform the prince, not daring to\nintrude their presence on him further; and yet regarding the king’s\ncommands, not willing to return with unbecoming haste. They loitered\nquietly along the way, and whomsoever they encountered, selecting those\nwho seemed like wise men, they interchanged such thoughts as move the\nlearned, hiding their true position, as men of title; then passing on,\nthey speeded on their way.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iii/bimbisara-raga-invites-the-prince/\">Bimbisâra Raga Invites the Prince</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The king now suppressing his grief, urged on his great teacher and chief\nminister, as one urges on with whip a ready horse, to hasten onwards as\nthe rapid stream; whilst they fatigued, yet with unflagging effort, come\nto the place of the sorrow-giving grove; then laying on one side the\nfive outward marks of dignity and regulating well their outward\ngestures, they entered the Brahmans’ quiet hermitage, and paid reverence\nto the Rishis.

He who enjoys a royal estate and yet seeks rescue, cannot dwell\nthus, this is no place for him; escape is born from quietness and rest;\nto be a king is to add distress and poison; to seek for rest and yet\naspire to royal condition are but contradictions; royalty and rescue,\nmotion and rest, like fire and water, having two principles, cannot be\nunited. So one resolved to seek escape cannot abide possessed of kingly\ndignity! And if you say a man may be a king, and at the same time\nprepare deliverance for himself, there is no certainty in this! to seek\ncertain escape is not to risk it thus; it is through this uncertain\nframe of mind that once a man gone forth is led to go back home again;\nbut I, my mind is not uncertain; severing the baited hook of\nrelationship, with straightforward purpose, I have left my home. Then\ntell me, why should I return again?”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The great minister, inwardly reflecting, thought, “The mind of the royal\nprince, my master, is full of wisdom, and agreeable to virtue, what he\nsays is reasonable and fitly framed.” Then he addressed the prince and\nsaid: “According to what your highness states, he who seeks religion\nmust seek it rightly; but this is not the fitting time for you; your\nroyal father, old and of declining years, thinking of you his son, adds\ngrief to grief; you say indeed, ‘I find my joy in rescue. To go back\nwould be apostasy.’ But yet your joy denotes unwisdom, and argues want\nof deep reflection; you do not see, because you seek the fruit, how vain\nto give up present duty. There are some who say, There is ‘hereafter’;\nothers there are who say, ‘Nothing hereafter.’ So whilst this question\nhangs in suspense, why should a man give up his present pleasure? If\nperchance there is ‘hereafter,’ we ought to bear patiently what it\nbrings; if you say, ‘Hereafter is not,’ then there is not either\nsalvation! If you say, ‘Hereafter is,’ you would not say, ‘Salvation\ncauses it.’ As earth is hard, or fire is hot, or water moist, or wind is\nmobile, ‘Hereafter’ is just so. It has its own distinct nature. So when\nwe speak of pure and impure, each comes from its own distinctive nature.\nIf you should say, ‘By some contrivance this can be removed,’ such an\nopinion argues folly. Every root within the moral world has its own\nnature predetermined; loving remembrance and forgetfulness, these have\ntheir nature fixed and positive; so likewise age, disease, and death,\nthese sorrows, who can escape by strategy? If you say, ‘Water can put\nout fire,’ or ‘Fire can cause water to boil and pass away,’ then this\nproves only that distinctive natures may be mutually destructive; but\nnature in harmony produces living things; so man when first conceived\nwithin the womb, his hands, his feet, and all his separate members, his\nspirit and his understanding, of themselves are perfected; but who is he\nwho does it? Who is he that points the prickly thorn? This too is\nnature, self-controlling. And take again the different kinds of beasts,\nthese are what they are, without desire on their part; and so, again,\nthe heaven-born beings, whom the self-existent (Isvara) rules, and all\nthe world of his creation; these have no self-possessed power of\nexpedients; for if they had a means of causing birth, there would be\nalso means for controlling death, and then what need of\nself-contrivance, or seeking for deliverance? There are those who say,\n‘I’ (the soul) is the cause of birth, and others who affirm, ‘I’ (the\nsoul) is the cause of death. There are some who say, ‘Birth comes from\nnothingness, and without any plan of ours we perish.’ Thus one is born a\nfortunate child, removed from poverty, of noble family, or learned in\ntestamentary lore of Rishis, or called to offer mighty sacrifices to the\ngods, born in either state, untouched by poverty, then their famous name\nbecomes to them ‘escape,’ their virtues handed down by name to us; yet\nif these attained their happiness, without contrivance of their own, how\nvain and fruitless is the toil of those who seek ‘escape.’ And you,\ndesirous of deliverance, purpose to practise some high expedient, whilst\nyour royal father frets and sighs; for a short while you have essayed\nthe road, and leaving home have wandered through the wilds, to return\nthen would not now be wrong; of old, King Ambarisha for a long while\ndwelt in the grievous forest, leaving his retinue and all his kinsfolk,\nbut afterwards returned and took the royal office; and so Râma, son of\nthe king of the country, leaving his country occupied the mountains, but\nhearing he was acting contrary to usage, returned and governed\nrighteously. And so the king of Sha-lo-po, called To-lo-ma, father and\nson, both wandered forth as hermits, but in the end came back again\ntogether; so Po-‘sz-tsau Muni, with On-tai-tieh, in the wild mountains\npractising as Brahmakârins, these too returned to their own country.\nThus all these worthies of a by-gone age, famous for their advance in\ntrue religion, came back home and royally governed, as lamps\nenlightening the world.
