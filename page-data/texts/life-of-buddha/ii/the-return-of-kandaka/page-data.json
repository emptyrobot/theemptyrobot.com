The purling streams so exquisitely pure\nand sparkling, and the wild beasts all unalarmed at man, caused the\nroyal prince’s heart to exult. Tired, the horse stopped of his own will,\nto breathe. “This, then,” he thought, “is a good sign and fortunate, and\ndoubtless indicates divine approval.” And now he saw belonging to the\nRishi, the various vessels used for asking charity, and other things\narranged by him in order, without the slightest trace of negligence.\nDismounting then he stroked his horse’s head, and cried, “You now have\nborne me well!”</p>\n<p>With loving eyes he looked at Kandaka: eyes like the pure cool surface\nof a placid lake and said, “Swift-footed! like a horse in pace, yea!\nswift as any light-winged bird, ever have you followed after me when\nriding, and deeply have I felt my debt of thanks, but not yet had you\nbeen tried in other ways; I only knew you as a man true-hearted, my mind\nnow wonders at your active powers of body; these two I now begin to see\nare yours; a man may have a heart most true and faithful, but strength\nof body may not too be his; bodily strength and perfect honesty of\nheart, I now have proof enough are yours. To be content to leave the\ntinselled world, and with swift foot to follow me, who would do this but\nfor some profit; if without profit to his kin, who would not shun it?\nBut you, with no private aim, have followed me, not seeking any present\nrecompense; as we nourish and bring up a child, to bind together and\nbring honor to a family, so we also reverence and obey a father, to gain\nobedience and attention from a begotten son; in this way all think of\ntheir own advantage; but you have come with me disdaining profit; with\nmany words I cannot hold you here, so let me say in brief to you, we\nhave now ended our relationship; take, then, my horse and ride back\nagain; for me, during the long night past, that place I sought to reach\nnow I have obtained.”</p>\n<p>Then taking off his precious neck-chain, he handed it to Kandaka. “Take\nthis,” he said, “I give it you, let it console you in your sorrow.” The\nprecious jewel in the tire that bound his head, bright-shining, lighting\nup his person, taking off and placing in his extended palm, like the sun\nwhich lights up Sumeru, he said, “O Kandaka! take this gem, and going\nback to where my father is, take the jewel and lay it reverently before\nhim, to signify my heart’s relation to him; and then, for me, request\nthe king to stifle every fickle feeling of affection, and say that I, to\nescape from birth and age and death, have entered on the wild forest of\npainful discipline; not that I may get a heavenly birth, much less\nbecause I have no tenderness of heart, or that I cherish any cause of\nbitterness, but only that I may escape this weight of sorrow. The\naccumulated long-night weight of covetous desire (love), I now desire to\nease the load so that it may be overthrown forever; therefore I seek the\nway of ultimate escape; if I should obtain emancipation, then shall I\nnever need to put away my kindred, to leave my home, to sever ties of\nlove. O! grieve not for your son! The five desires of sense beget the\nsorrow; those held by lust themselves induce the sorrow. My very\nancestors, victorious kings, thinking their throne established and\nimmovable, have handed down to me their kingly wealth; I, thinking only\non religion, put it all away; the royal mothers at the end of life their\ncherished treasures leave for their sons, those sons who covet much such\nworldly profit; but I rejoice to have acquired religious wealth; if you\nsay that I am young and tender, and that the time for seeking wisdom is\nnot come, you ought to know that to seek true religion, there never is a\ntime not fit; impermanence and fickleness, the hate of death, these ever\nfollow us, and therefore I embrace the present day, convinced that now\nis time to seek religion. With such entreaties as the above, you must\nmake matters plain on my behalf; but, pray you, cause my father not to\nthink longingly after me; let him destroy all recollection of me, and\ncut out from his soul the ties of love; and you, grieve not because of\nwhat I say, but recollect to give the king my message.”</p>\n<p>Kandaka hearing respectfully the words of exhortation, blinded and\nconfused through choking sorrow, with hands outstretched did worship;\nand answering the prince, he spoke, “The orders that you give me will, I\nfear, add grief to grief, and sorrow thus increased will deepen, as the\nelephant who struggles into deeper mire. When the ties of love are\nrudely snapped, who, that has any heart, would not grieve! The golden\nore may still by stamping be broken up, how much more the feelings\nchoked with sorrow! the prince has grown up in a palace, with every care\nbestowed upon his tender person, and now he gives his body to the rough\nand thorny forest; how will he be able to bear a life of privation? When\nfirst you ordered me to equip your steed, my mind was indeed sorely\ntroubled, but the heavenly powers urged me on, causing me to hasten the\npreparation of the horse, but what is the intention that urges the\nprince, to resolve thus to leave his secure palace? The people of\nKapilavastu, and all the country afflicted with grief; your father, now\nan old man, mindful of his son, loving him moreover tenderly; surely\nthis determination to leave your home, this is not according to duty; it\nis wrong, surely, to disregard father and mother—we cannot speak of\nsuch a thing with propriety! Gotami, too, who has nourished you so long,\nfed you with milk when a helpless child, such love as hers cannot easily\nbe forgotten; it is impossible surely to turn the back on a benefactor;\nthe highly gifted virtuous mother of a child, is ever respected by the\nmost distinguished families; to inherit distinction and then to turn\nround, is not the mark of a distinguished man. The illustrious child of\nYasodharâ, who has inherited a kingdom, rightly governed, his years now\ngradually ripening, should not thus go away from and forsake his home;\nbut though he has gone away from his royal father, and forsaken his\nfamily and his kin, forbid it he should still drive me away, let me not\ndepart from the feet of my master; my heart is bound to thee, as the\nheat is bound up in the boiling water. I cannot return without thee to\nmy country; to return and leave the prince thus, in the midst of the\nsolitude of the desert, then should I be like Sumanta, who left and\nforsook Râma; and now if I return alone to the palace, what words can I\naddress to the king? How can I reply to the reproaches of all the\ndwellers in the palace with suitable words? Therefore let the prince\nrather tell me, how I may truly describe, and with what device, the\ndisfigured body, and the merit-seeking condition of the hermit! I am\nfull of fear and alarm, my tongue can utter no words; tell me then what\nwords to speak; but who is there in the empire will believe me? If I say\nthat the moon’s rays are scorching, there are men, perhaps, who may\nbelieve me; but they will not believe that the prince, in his conduct,\nwill act without piety; for the prince’s heart is sincere and refined,\nalways actuated with pity and love to men. To be deeply affected with\nlove, and yet to forsake the object of love, this surely is opposed to a\nconstant mind. O then, for pity’s sake! return to your home, and thus\nappease my foolish longings.”</p>\n<p>The prince having listened to Kandaka, pitying his grief expressed in so\nmany words, with heart resolved and strong in its determination, spoke\nthus to him once more, and said: “Why thus on my account do you feel the\npain of separation? you should overcome this sorrowful mood, it is for\nyou to comfort yourself; all creatures, each in its way, foolishly\narguing that all things are constant, would influence me to-day not to\nforsake my kin and relatives; but when dead and come to be a ghost, how\nthen, let them say, can I be kept? My loving mother when she bore me,\nwith deep affection painfully carried me, and then when born she died,\nnot permitted to nourish me. One alive, the other dead, gone by\ndifferent roads, where now shall she be found? Like as in a wilderness,\non some high tree, all the birds living with their mates assemble in the\nevening and at dawn disperse, so are the separations of the world; the\nfloating clouds rise like a high mountain, from the four quarters they\nfill the void, in a moment again they are separated and disappear; so is\nit with the habitations of men; people from the beginning have erred\nthus, binding themselves in society and by the ties of love, and then,\nas after a dream, all is dispersed; do not then recount the names of my\nrelatives; for like the wood which is produced in spring, gradually\ngrows and brings forth its leaves, which again fall in the\nautumn-chilly-dews—if the different parts of the same body are thus\ndivided—how much more men who are united in society! and how shall the\nties of relationship escape rending? Cease therefore your grief and\nexpostulation, obey my commands and return home; the thought of your\nreturn alone will save me, and perhaps after your return I also may come\nback. The men of Kapilavastu, hearing that my heart is fixed, will\ndismiss from their minds all thought of me, but you may make known my\nwords, ‘when I have escaped from the sad ocean of birth and death, then\nafterwards I will come back again; but I am resolved, if I obtain not my\nquest, my body shall perish in the mountain wilds.‘” The white horse\nhearing the prince, as he uttered these true and earnest words, bent his\nknee and licked his foot, whilst he sighed deeply and wept. Then the\nprince with his soft and glossy palm, fondly stroking the head of the\nwhite horse, said, “Do not let sorrow rise within, I grieve indeed at\nlosing you, my gallant steed—so strong and active, your merit now has\ngained its end; you shall enjoy for long a respite from an evil birth,\nbut for the present take as your reward these precious jewels and this\nglittering sword, and with them follow closely after Kandaka.” The\nprince then drawing forth his sword, glancing in the light as the\ndragon’s eye, cut off the knot of hair with its jewelled stud, and\nforthwith cast it into space; ascending upwards to the firmament, it\nfloated there as the wings of the phoenix; then all the Devas of the\nTrayastrimsa heavens seizing the hair, returned with it to their\nheavenly abodes; desiring always to adore the feet (offer religious\nservice), how much rather now possessed of the crowning locks, with\nunfeigned piety do they increase their adoration, and shall do till the\ntrue law has died away.</p>\n<p>Then the royal prince thought thus, “My adornments now are gone forever,\nthere only now remain these silken garments, which are not in keeping\nwith a hermit’s life.”</p>\n<p>Then the Deva of the Pure abode, knowing the heart-ponderings of the\nprince, transformed himself into a hunter’s likeness, holding his bow,\nhis arrows in his girdle, his body girded with a Kashâya-colored robe,\nthus he advanced in front of the prince. The prince considering this\ngarment of his, the color of the ground, a fitting pure attire, becoming\nto the utmost the person of a Rishi, not fit for a hunter’s dress,\nforthwith called to the hunter, as he stood before him, in accents soft,\nand thus addressed him: “That dress of thine belikes me much, as if it\nwere not foul, and this my dress I’ll give thee in exchange, so please\nthee.”</p>\n<p>The hunter then addressed the prince, “Although I ill can spare this\ngarment, which I use as a disguise among the deer, that alluring them\nwithin reach I may kill them, notwithstanding, as it so pleases you, I\nam now willing to bestow it in exchange for yours.” The hunter having\nreceived the sumptuous dress, took again his heavenly body.</p>\n<p>The prince and Kandaka, the coachman, seeing this, thought deeply thus:\n“This garment is of no common character, it is not what a worldly man\nhas worn”—and in the prince’s heart great joy arose, as he regarded the\ncoat with double reverence, and forthwith giving all the other things to\nKandaka, he himself was clad in it, of Kashâya color; then like the dark\nand lowering cloud, that surrounds the disc of the sun or moon, he for a\nmoment gazed, scanning his steps, then entered on the hermit’s grot;\nKandaka following him with wistful eyes, his body disappeared, nor was\nit seen again. “My lord and master now has left his father’s house, his\nkinsfolk and myself,” he cried; “he now has clothed himself in hermit’s\ngarb, and entered the painful forest.” Raising his hands he called on\nHeaven, o’erpowered with grief he could not move; till holding by the\nwhite steed’s neck, he tottered forward on the homeward road, turning\nagain and often looking back, his body going on, his heart\nback-hastening; now lost in thought and self-forgetful, now looking down\nto earth, then raising up his drooping eye to heaven, falling at times\nand then rising again, thus weeping as he went, he pursued his way\nhomewards.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/ii/entering-the-place-of-austerities/\">Entering the Place of Austerities</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And now the night was in a moment gone, and sight restored to all\ncreated things, when the royal prince looked through the wood, and saw\nthe abode of Po-ka, the Rishi.
