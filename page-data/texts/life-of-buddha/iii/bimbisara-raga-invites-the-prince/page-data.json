The trees and shrubs and flowers in bloom, the flowing\nfountains, and the cooling rills; all these he gazed upon—then passing\non, he entered the city of the five peaks, calm and peaceful, as one\ncome down from heaven. The country folk, seeing the royal prince, his\ncomeliness and his excessive grace, though young in years, yet glorious\nin his person, incomparable as the appearance of a great master, seeing\nhim thus, strange thoughts affected them, as if they gazed upon the\nbanner of Isvara. They stayed the foot, who passed athwart the path;\nthose hastened on, who were behind; those going before, turned back\ntheir heads and gazed with earnest, wistful look. The marks and\ndistinguishing points of his person, on these they fixed their eyes\nwithout fatigue, and then approached with reverent homage, joining both\ntheir hands in salutation. With all there was a sense of wondrous joy,\nas in their several ways they offered what they had, looking at his\nnoble and illustrious features; bending down their bodies modestly,\ncorrecting every careless or unseemly gesture, thus they showed their\nreverence to him silently; those who with anxious heart, seeking\nrelease, were moved by love, with feelings composed, bowed down the\nmore. Great men and women, in their several engagements, at the same\ntime arrested on their way, paid to his person and his presence homage:\nand following him as they gazed, they went not back. For the white\ncircle between his eyebrows adorning his wide and violet-colored eyes,\nhis noble body bright as gold, his pure and web-joined fingers, all\nthese, though he were but a hermit, were marks of one who was a holy\nking; and now the men and women of Râgagriha, the old and young alike,\nwere moved, and cried, “This man so noble as a recluse, what common joy\nis this for us!” At this time Bimbisâra Râga, placed upon a high tower\nof observation, seeing all those men and women, in different ways\nexhibiting one mark of surprise, calling before him some man outside,\ninquired at once the cause of it; this one bending his knee below the\ntower, told fully what he had seen and heard, “That one of the Sâkya\nrace, renowned of old, a prince most excellent and wonderful, divinely\nwise, beyond the way of this world, a fitting king to rule the eight\nregions, now without home, is here, and all men are paying homage to\nhim.”</p>\n<p>The king on hearing this was deeply moved at heart, and though his body\nwas restrained, his soul had gone. Calling his ministers speedily before\nhim, and all his nobles and attendants, he bade them follow secretly the\nprince’s steps, to observe what charity was given. So, in obedience to\nthe command, they followed and watched him steadfastly, as with even\ngait and unmoved presence he entered on the town and begged his food,\naccording to the rule of all great hermits, with joyful mien and\nundisturbed mind, not anxious whether much or little alms were given;\nwhatever he received, costly or poor, he placed within his bowl, then\nturned back to the wood, and having eaten it and drunk of the flowing\nstream, he joyous sat upon the immaculate mountain. There he beheld the\ngreen trees fringing with their shade the crags, the scented flowers\ngrowing between the intervals, whilst the peacocks and the other birds,\njoyously flying, mingled their notes; his sacred garments bright and\nlustrous, shone as the sun-lit mulberry leaves; the messengers beholding\nhis fixed composure, one by one returning, reported what they had seen;\nthe king hearing it, was moved at heart, and forthwith ordered his royal\nequipment to be brought, his god-like crown and his flower-bespangled\nrobes; then, as the lion-king, he strode forth, and choosing certain\naged persons of consideration, learned men, able calmly and wisely to\ndiscriminate, he, with them, led the way, followed by a hundred thousand\npeople, who like a cloud ascended with the king the royal mountain.</p>\n<p>And now beholding the dignity of Bodhisattva, every outward gesture\nunder government, sitting with ease upon the mountain crag, as the moon\nshining limpid in the pure heavens, so was his matchless beauty and\npurity of grace; then as the converting presence of religion dwelling\nwithin the heart makes it reverential, so, beholding him, he reverently\napproached, even as divine Sâkara comes to the presence of Mo-hi-su-ma,\nso with every outward form of courtesy and reverence the king approached\nand asked him respectfully of his welfare.</p>\n<p>Bodhisattva, answering as he was moved, in his turn made similar\ninquiries. Then the king, the questioning over, sat down with dignity\nupon a clean-faced rock. And so he steadfastly beheld the divine\nappearance of the prince, the sweetness and complacency of his features\nrevealing what his station was and high estate, his family renown,\nreceived by inheritance; the king, who for a time restrained his\nfeelings, now wishful to get rid of doubts, inquired why one descended\nfrom the royal family of the sun-brightness having attended to religious\nsacrifices through ten thousand generations, whereof the virtue had\ndescended as his full inheritance, increasing and accumulating until\nnow, why he so excellent in wisdom, so young in years, had now become a\nrecluse, rejecting the position of a Kakravartin’s son, begging his\nfood, despising family fame, his beauteous form, fit for perfumes and\nanointings, why clothed with coarse Kasâya garments; the hand which\nought to grasp the reins of empire, instead thereof, taking its little\nstint of food; if indeed (the king continued) you were not of royal\ndescent, and would receive as an offering the transfer of this land,\nthen would I divide with you my empire; saying this, he scarcely hoped\nto excite his feelings, who had left his home and family, to be a\nhermit. Then forthwith the king proceeded thus: “Give just weight I pray\nyou to my truthful words: desire for power is kin to nobleness, and so\nis just pride of fame or family or wealth or personal appearance; no\nlonger having any wish to subdue the proud, or to bend others down and\nso get thanks from men, it were better, then, to give to the strong and\nwarlike martial arms to wear, for them to follow war and by their power\nto get supremacy; but when by one’s own power a kingdom falls to hand,\nwho would not then accept the reins of empire? The wise man knows the\ntime to take religion, wealth, and worldly pleasure. But if he obtains\nnot the threefold profit, then in the end he abates his earnest efforts,\nand reverencing religion, he lets go material wealth. Wealth is the one\ndesire of worldly men; to be rich and lose all desire for religion, this\nis to gain but outside wealth. But to be poor and even thus despise\nreligion, what pleasure can indulgence give in such a case! But when\npossessed of all the three, and when enjoyed with reason and propriety,\nthen religion, wealth, and pleasure make what is rightly called a great\nmaster; permit not, then, your perfectly endowed body to lay aside its\nglory, without reward; the Kakravartin, as a monarch, ruled the four\nempires of the world, and shared with Sakra his royal throne, but was\nunequal to the task of ruling heaven. But you, with your redoubtable\nstrength, may well grasp both heavenly and human power; I do not rely\nupon my kingly power, in my desire to keep you here by force, but seeing\nyou change your comeliness of person, and wearing the hermit’s garb,\nwhilst it makes me reverence you for your virtue, moves me with pity and\nregret for you as a man; you now go begging your food, and I offer you\nthe whole land as yours; whilst you are young and lusty enjoy yourself.\nDuring middle life acquire wealth, and when old and all your abilities\nripened, then is the time for following the rules of religion; when\nyoung to encourage religious fervor, is to destroy the sources of\ndesire; but when old and the breath is less eager, then is the time to\nseek religious solitude; when old we should avoid, as a shame, desire of\nwealth, but get honor in the world by a religious life; but when young,\nand the heart light and elastic, then is the time to partake of\npleasure, in boon companionship to indulge in gayety, and partake to the\nfull of mutual intercourse; but as years creep on, giving up indulgence,\nto observe the ordinances of religion, to mortify the five desires, and\ngo on increasing a joyful and religious heart, is not this the law of\nthe eminent kings of old, who as a great company paid worship to heaven,\nand borne on the dragon’s back received the joys of celestial abodes?\nAll these divine and victorious monarchs, glorious in person, richly\nadorned, thus having as a company performed their religious offering, in\nthe end received the reward of their conduct in heaven.” Thus Bimbasâra\nRâga used every kind of winning expedient in argument The royal prince,\nunmoved and fixed, remained firm as Mount Sumeru.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iii/the-reply-to-bimbasara-raga/\">The Reply to Bimbasâra Râga</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>The distance from the place of the interview with the ministers to the Vulture Peak would be, in a straight line, about 150 miles.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The royal prince, departing from the court-master (i.e. the Purohita)\nand the great minister, Saddharma, keeping along the stream, then\ncrossing the Ganges, he took the road towards the Vulture Peak,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"sup","properties":{"id":"fnref-1"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#fn-1","className":["footnote-ref"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"1"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nhidden among the five mountains, standing alone a lovely peak as a roof\namid the others.
