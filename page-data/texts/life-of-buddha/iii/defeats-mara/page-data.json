Now this Mâra râga had three daughters, mincingly\nbeautiful and of a pleasant countenance, in every way fit by artful ways\nto inflame a man with love, highest in this respect among the Devis. The\nfirst was named Yuh-yen, the second Neng-yueh-gin, the third Ngai-loh.\nThese three, at this time, advanced together, and addressed their father\nPisuna and said: “May we not know the trouble that afflicts you?”</p>\n<p>The father, calming his feelings, addressed his daughters thus: “The\nworld has now a great Muni, he has taken a strong oath as a helmet, he\nholds a mighty bow in his hand, wisdom is the diamond shaft he uses. His\nobject is to get the mastery in the world, to ruin and destroy my\nterritory; I am myself unequal to him, for all men will believe in him,\nand all find refuge in the way of his salvation; then will my land be\ndesert and unoccupied. But as when a man transgresses the laws of\nmorality, his body is then empty. So now, the eye of wisdom, not yet\nopened in this man, whilst my empire still has peace, I will go and\noverturn his purpose, and break down and divide the ridge-pole of his\nhouse.”</p>\n<p>Seizing then his bow and his five arrows, with all his retinue of male\nand female attendants, he went to that grove of “fortunate rest” with\nthe vow that the world should not find peace. Then seeing the Muni,\nquiet and still, preparing to cross the sea of the three worlds, in his\nleft hand grasping his bow, with his right hand pointing his arrow, he\naddressed Bodhisattva and said: “Kshatriya! rise up quickly! for you may\nwell fear! your death is at hand; you may practise your own religious\nsystem, but let go this effort after the law of deliverance for others;\nwage warfare in the field of charity as a cause of merit, appease the\ntumultuous world, and so in the end reach your reward in heaven. This is\na way renowned and well established, in which former saints have walked,\nRishis and kings and men of eminence; but this system of penury and\nalms-begging is unworthy of you. Now then if you rise not, you had best\nconsider with yourself, that if you give not up your vow, and tempt me\nto let fly an arrow, how that Aila, grandchild of Soma, by one of these\narrows just touched, as by a fanning of the wind, lost his reason and\nbecame a madman. And how the Rishi Vimala, practising austerities,\nhearing the sound of one of these darts, his heart possessed by great\nfear, bewildered and darkened he lost his true nature; how much less can\nyou—a late-born one—hope to escape this dart of mine. Quickly arise\nthen! if hardly you may get away! This arrow full of rankling poison,\nfearfully insidious where it strikes a foe! See now! with all my force,\nI point it! and are you resting in the face of such calamity? How is it\nthat you fear not this dread arrow? say! why do you not tremble?” Mâra\nuttered such fear-inspiring threats, bent on overawing Bodhisattva. But\nBodhisattva’s heart remained unmoved; no doubt, no fear was present.\nThen Mâra instantly discharged his arrow, whilst the three women came in\nfront. Bodhisattva regarded not the arrow, nor considered aught the\nwomen three. Mâra râga now was troubled much with doubt, and muttered\nthus ‘twixt heart and mouth: “Long since the maiden of the snowy\nmountains, shooting at Mahesvara, constrained him to change his mind;\nand yet Bodhisattva is unmoved, and heeds not even this dart of mine,\nnor the three heavenly women! nought prevails to move his heart or raise\none spark of love within him. Now must I assemble my army-host, and\npress him sore by force;” having thought thus awhile, Mâra’s army\nsuddenly assembled round. Each assumed his own peculiar form; some were\nholding spears, others grasping swords, others snatching up trees,\nothers wielding diamond maces; armed with every sort of weapon. Some had\nheads like hogs, others like fishes, others like asses, others like\nhorses; some with forms like snakes or like the ox or savage tiger;\nlion-headed, dragon-headed, and like every other kind of beast. Some had\nmany heads on one body-trunk, with faces having but a single eye, and\nthen again with many eyes; some with great-bellied mighty bodies. And\nothers thin and skinny, belly-less; others long-legged, mighty-kneed;\nothers big-shanked and fat-calved; some with long and claw-like nails.\nSome were headless, breastless, faceless; some with two feet and many\nbodies; some with big faces looking every way; some pale and\nashy-colored; others colored like the bright star rising, others\nsteaming fiery vapor, some with ears like elephants, with humps like\nmountains, some with naked forms covered with hair. Some with leather\nskins for clothing, their faces parti-colored, crimson, and white; some\nwith tiger skins as robes, some with snake skins over them, some with\ntinkling bells around their waists, others with twisted screw-like hair,\nothers with hair dishevelled covering the body, some breath-suckers,\nothers body-snatchers, some dancing and shrieking awhile, some jumping\nonwards with their feet together, some striking one another as they\nwent. Others waving in the air, others flying and leaping between the\ntrees, others howling, or hooting, or screaming, or whining, with their\nevil noises shaking the great earth; thus this wicked goblin troop\nencircled on its four sides the Bodhi tree; some bent on tearing his\nbody to pieces, others on devouring it whole; from the four sides flames\nbelched forth, and fiery steam ascended up to heaven; tempestuous winds\narose on every side; the mountain forests shook and quaked. Wind, fire,\nand steam, with dust combined, produced a pitchy darkness, rendering all\ninvisible. And now the Devas well affected to the law, and all the Nâgas\nand the spirits, all incensed at this host of Mâra, with anger fired,\nwept tears of blood; the great company of Suddhavâsa gods, beholding\nMâra tempting Bodhisattva, free from low-feeling, with hearts\nundisturbed by passion, moved by pity towards him and commiseration,\ncame in a body to behold the Bodhisattva, so calmly seated and so\nundisturbed, surrounded with an uncounted host of devils, shaking the\nheaven and earth with sounds ill-omened. Bodhisattva silent and quiet in\nthe midst remained, his countenance as bright as heretofore, unchanged;\nlike the great lion-king placed amongst all the beasts howling and\ngrowling round him so he sat, a sight unseen before, so strange and\nwonderful! The host of Mâra hastening, as arranged, each one exerting\nhis utmost force, taking each other’s place in turns, threatening every\nmoment to destroy him. Fiercely staring, grinning with their teeth,\nflying tumultuously, bounding here and there; but Bodhisattva, silently\nbeholding them, watched them as one would watch the games of children.\nAnd now the demon host waxed fiercer and more angry, and added force to\nforce, in further conflict; grasping at stones they could not lift, or\nlifting them, they could not let them go. Their flying spears, lances,\nand javelins, stuck fast in space, refusing to descend; the angry\nthunderdrops and mighty hail, with these, were changed into five-colored\nlotus flowers, whilst the foul poison of the dragon snakes was turned to\nspicy-breathing air. Thus all these countless sorts of creatures,\nwishing to destroy the Bodhisattva, unable to remove him from the spot,\nwere with their own weapons wounded. Now Mâra had an aunt-attendant\nwhose name was Ma-kia-ka-li, who held a skull-dish in her hands, and\nstood in front of Bodhisattva, and with every kind of winsome gesture,\ntempted to lust the Bodhisattva. So all these followers of Mâra,\npossessed of every demon-body form, united in discordant uproar, hoping\nto terrify Bodhisattva; but not a hair of his was moved, and Mâra’s host\nwas filled with sorrow. Then in the air the crowd of angels, their forms\ninvisible, raised their voices, saying: “Behold the great Muni; his mind\nunmoved by any feeling of resentment, whilst all that wicked Mâra race,\nbesotted, are vainly bent on his destruction; let go your foul and\nmurderous thoughts against that silent Muni, calmly seated! You cannot\nwith a breath move the Sumeru mountain. Fire may freeze, water may burn,\nthe roughened earth may grow soft and pliant, but ye cannot hurt the\nBodhisattva! Through ages past disciplined by suffering. Bodhisattva\nrightly trained in thought, ever advancing in the use of ‘means,’ pure\nand illustrious for wisdom, loving and merciful to all. These four\nconspicuous virtues cannot with him be rent asunder, so as to make it\nhard or doubtful whether he gain the highest wisdom. For as the thousand\nrays of yonder sun must drown the darkness of the world, or as the\nboring wood must kindle fire, or as the earth deep-dug gives water, so\nhe who perseveres in the ‘right means,’ by seeking thus, will find. The\nworld without instruction, poisoned by lust and hate and ignorance;\nbecause he pitied ‘flesh,’ so circumstanced, he sought on their account\nthe joy of wisdom. Why then would you molest and hinder one who seeks to\nbanish sorrow from the world? The ignorance that everywhere prevails is\ndue to false pernicious books, and therefore Bodhisattva, walking\nuprightly, would lead and draw men after him. To obscure and blind the\ngreat world-leader, this undertaking is impossible, for ‘tis as though\nin the Great Desert a man would purposely mislead the merchant-guide. So\n‘all flesh’ having fallen into darkness, ignorant of where they are\ngoing, for their sakes he would light the lamp of wisdom; say then! why\nwould you extinguish it? All flesh engulfed and overwhelmed in the great\nsea of birth and death, this one prepares the boat of wisdom; say then!\nwhy destroy and sink it? Patience is the sprouting of religion, firmness\nits root, good conduct is the flower, the enlightened heart the boughs\nand branches. Wisdom supreme the entire tree, the ‘transcendent law’ the\nfruit, its shade protects all living things; say then! why would you cut\nit down? Lust, hate, and ignorance, are the rack and bolt, the yoke\nplaced on the shoulder of the world; through ages long he has practised\nausterities to rescue men from these their fetters. He now shall\ncertainly attain his end, sitting on this right-established throne; as\nall the previous Buddhas, firm and compact like a diamond. Though all\nthe earth were moved and shaken, yet would this place be fixed and\nstable; him, thus fixed and well assured, think not that you can\noverturn. Bring down and moderate your mind’s desire, banish these high\nand envious thoughts, prepare yourselves for right reflection, be\npatient in your services.”</p>\n<p>Mâra hearing these sounds in space, and seeing Bodhisattva still\nunmoved, filled with fear and banishing his high and supercilious\nthoughts, again took up his way to heaven above. Whilst all his host\nwere scattered, o’erwhelmed with grief and disappointment, fallen from\ntheir high estate, bereft of their warrior pride, their warlike weapons\nand accoutrements thrown heedlessly and cast away ‘mid woods and\ndeserts. Like as when some cruel chieftain slain, the hateful band is\nall dispersed and scattered, so the host of Mara disconcerted, fled\naway. The mind of Bodhisattva now reposed peaceful and quiet. The\nmorning sunbeams brighten with the dawn, the dust-like mist dispersing,\ndisappears; the moon and stars pale their faint light, the barriers of\nthe night are all removed, whilst from above a fall of heavenly flowers\npay their sweet tribute to the Bodhisattva.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iii/o-wei-san-pou-ti-abhisambodhi/\">O-wei-san-pou-ti (Abhisambodhi)</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The great Rishi, of the royal tribe of Rishis, beneath the Bodhi tree\nfirmly established, resolved by oath to perfect the way of complete\ndeliverance."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The spirits, Nâgas, and the heavenly multitude, all were filled with\njoy; but Mâra Devarâga, enemy of religion, alone was grieved, and\nrejoiced not; lord of the five desires, skilled in all the arts of\nwarfare, the foe of those who seek deliverance, therefore his name is\nrightly given Pisuna.
