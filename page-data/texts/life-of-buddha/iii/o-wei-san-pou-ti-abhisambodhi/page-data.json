Every kind of Sâmadhi in order passed before\nhis eyes. During the first watch he entered on “right perception” and in\nrecollection all former births passed before his eyes. Born in such a\nplace, of such a name, and downwards to his present birth, so through\nhundreds, thousands, myriads, all his births and deaths he knew.\nCountless in number were they, of every kind and sort; then knowing,\ntoo, his family relationships, great pity rose within his heart.</p>\n<p>This sense of deep compassion passed, he once again considered “all that\nlives,” and how they moved within the six portions of life’s revolution,\nno final term to birth and death; hollow all, and false and transient as\nthe plantain tree, or as a dream, or phantasy. Then in the middle watch\nof night, he reached to knowledge of the pure Devas, and beheld before\nhim every creature, as one sees images upon a mirror; all creatures born\nand born again to die, noble and mean, the poor and rich, reaping the\nfruit of right or evil doing, and sharing happiness or misery in\nconsequence. First he considered and distinguished evil-doers’ works,\nthat such must ever reap an evil birth. Then he considered those who\npractise righteous deeds, that these must gain a place with men or gods;\nbut those again born in the nether hells, he saw participating in every\nkind of misery; swallowing molten brass, the iron skewers piercing their\nbodies, confined within the boiling caldron, driven and made to enter\nthe fiery oven dwelling, food for hungry, long-toothed dogs, or preyed\nupon by brain-devouring birds; dismayed by fire, then they wander\nthrough thick woods, with leaves like razors gashing their limbs, while\nknives divide their writhing bodies, or hatchets lop their members, bit\nby bit; drinking the bitterest poisons, their fate yet holds them back\nfrom death. Thus those who found their joy in evil deeds, he saw\nreceiving now their direst sorrow; a momentary taste of pleasure here, a\ndreary length of suffering there. A laugh or joke because of others’\npain, a crying out and weeping now at punishment received. Surely if\nliving creatures saw the consequence of all their evil deeds,\nself-visited, with hatred would they turn and leave them, fearing the\nruin following—the blood and death. He saw, moreover, all the fruits of\nbirth as beasts, each deed entailing its own return; and when death\nensues born in some other form (beast shape), different in kind\naccording to the deeds. Some doomed to die for the sake of skin or\nflesh, some for their horns or hair or bones or wings; others torn or\nkilled in mutual conflict, friend or relative before, contending thus;\nsome burdened with loads or dragging heavy weights, others pierced and\nurged on by pricking goads. Blood flowing down their tortured forms,\nparched and hungry—no relief afforded; then, turning round, he saw one\nwith the other struggling, possessed of no independent strength. Flying\nthrough air or sunk in deep water, yet no place as a refuge left from\ndeath. He saw, moreover, those, misers and covetous, born now as hungry\nghosts; vast bodies like the towering mountain, with mouths as small as\nany needle-tube, hungry and thirsty, nought but fire and poisoned flame\nto enwrap their burning forms within. Covetous, they would not give to\nthose who sought, or duped the man who gave in charity, now born among\nthe famished ghosts, they seek for food, but cannot find withal. The\nrefuse of the unclean man they fain would eat, but this is changed and\nlost before it can be eaten. Oh! if a man believes that covetousness is\nthus repaid, as in their case, would he not give his very flesh in\ncharity even as Sivi râga did! Then, once more he saw, those reborn as\nmen, with bodies like some foul sewer, ever moving ‘midst the direst\nsufferings, born from the womb to fear and trembling, with body tender,\ntouching anything its feelings painful, as if cut with knives. Whilst\nborn in this condition, no moment free from chance of death, labor, and\nsorrow, yet seeking birth again, and being born again, enduring pain.\nThen he saw those who by a higher merit were enjoying heaven; a thirst\nfor love ever consuming them, their merit ended with the end of life,\nthe five signs warning them of death. Just as the blossom that decays,\nwithering away, is robbed of all its shining tints; not all their\nassociates, living still, though grieving, can avail to save the rest.\nThe palaces and joyous precincts empty now, the Devis all alone and\ndesolate, sitting or asleep upon the dusty earth, weep bitterly in\nrecollection of their loves. Those who are born, sad in decay; those who\nare dead, belovéd, cause of grief; thus ever struggling on, preparing\nfuture pain, covetous they seek the joys of heaven, obtaining which,\nthese sorrows come apace; despicable joys! oh, who would covet them!\nusing such mighty efforts to obtain, and yet unable thence to banish\npain. Alas, alas! these Devas, too, alike deceived—no difference is\nthere! through lapse of ages bearing suffering, striving to crush desire\nand lust, now certainly expecting long reprieve, and yet once more\ndestined to fall! in hell enduring every kind of pain, as beasts tearing\nand killing one the other, as Pretas parched with direst thirst, as men\nworn out, seeking enjoyment; although, they say, when born in heaven,\n“then we shall escape these greater ills.” Deceived, alas! no single\nplace exempt, in every birth incessant pain! Alas! the sea of birth and\ndeath revolving thus—an ever-whirling wheel—all flesh immersed within\nits waves cast here and there without reliance! thus with his pure Deva\neyes he thoughtfully considered the five domains of life. He saw that\nall was empty and vain alike! with no dependence! like the plantain or\nthe bubble. Then, on the third eventful watch, he entered on the deep,\ntrue apprehension; he meditated on the entire world of creatures,\nwhirling in life’s tangle, born to sorrow; the crowds who live, grow\nold, and die, innumerable for multitude. Covetous, lustful, ignorant,\ndarkly-fettered, with no way known for final rescue. Rightly\nconsidering, inwardly he reflected from what source birth and death\nproceed. He was assured that age and death must come from birth as from\na source. For since a man has born with him a body, that body must\ninherit pain. Then looking further whence comes birth, he saw it came\nfrom life-deeds done elsewhere; then with his Deva-eyes scanning these\ndeeds, he saw they were not framed by Isvara. They were not self-caused,\nthey were not personal existences, nor were they either uncaused; then,\nas one who breaks the first bamboo joint finds all the rest easy to\nseparate, having discerned the cause of birth and death, he gradually\ncame to see the truth; deeds come from upâdâna, like as fire which\ncatches hold of grass; upâdâna comes from trishnâ, just as a little fire\ninflames the mountains; trishnâ comes from vedanâ, the perception of\npain and pleasure, the desire for rest; as the starving or the thirsty\nman seeks food and drink, so “sensation” brings “desire” for life; then\ncontact is the cause of all sensation, producing the three kinds of pain\nor pleasure, even as by art of man the rubbing wood produces fire for\nany use or purpose; contact is born from the six entrances.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> The six\nentrances are caused by name and thing, just as the germ grows to the\nstem and leaf; name and thing are born from knowledge, as the seed which\ngerminates and brings forth leaves. Knowledge, in turn, proceeds from\nname and thing, the two are intervolved leaving no remnant; by some\nconcurrent cause knowledge engenders name and thing, whilst by some\nother cause concurrent, name and thing engender knowledge. Just as a man\nand ship advance together, the water and the land mutually involved;\nthus knowledge brings forth name and thing; name and thing produce the\nroots. The roots engender contact; contact again brings forth sensation;\nsensation brings forth longing desire; longing desire produces upâdâna.\nUpâdâna is the cause of deeds; and these again engender birth; birth\nagain produces age and death; so does this one incessant round cause the\nexistence of all living things. Rightly illumined, thoroughly perceiving\nthis, firmly established, thus was he enlightened; destroy birth, old\nage and death will cease; destroy bhava then will birth cease; destroy\n“cleaving” then will bhava end; destroy desire then will cleaving end;\ndestroy sensation then will trishnâ end. Destroy contact then will end\nsensation; destroy the six entrances, then will contact cease; the six\nentrances all destroyed, from this, moreover, names and things will\ncease. Knowledge destroyed, names and things will cease; names and\nthings destroyed, then knowledge perishes; ignorance destroyed, then the\nconstituents of individual life will die; the great Rishi was thus\nperfected in wisdom. Thus perfected, Buddha then devised for the world’s\nbenefit the eightfold path, right sight, and so on, the only true path\nfor the world to tread. Thus did he complete the end of “self,” as fire\ngoes out for want of grass; thus he had done what he would have men do;\nhe first had found the way of perfect knowledge. He finished thus the\nfirst great lesson; entering the great Rishi’s house (dreamless sleep),\nthe darkness disappeared; light coming on, perfectly silent, all at\nrest, he reached at last the exhaustless source of truth; lustrous with\nall wisdom the great Rishi sat, perfect in gifts, whilst one convulsive\nthroe shook the wide earth. And now the world was calm again and bright,\nwhen Devas, Nâgas, spirits, all assembled, amidst the void raise\nheavenly music, and make their offerings as the law directs. A gentle\ncooling breeze sprang up around, and from the sky a fragrant rain\ndistilled; exquisite flowers, not seasonable, bloomed; sweet fruits\nbefore their time were ripened. Great Mandâras, and every sort of\nheavenly precious flower, from space in rich confusion fell, as tribute\nto the illustrious monk. Creatures of every different kind were moved\none towards the other lovingly; fear and terror altogether put away,\nnone entertained a hateful thought, and all things living in the world\nwith faultless men consorted freely; the Devas giving up their heavenly\njoys, sought rather to alleviate the sinner’s sufferings. Pain and\ndistress grew less and less, the moon of wisdom waxed apace; whilst all\nthe Rishis of the Ikshvâku clan who had received a heavenly birth,\nbeholding Buddha thus benefitting men, were filled with joy and\nsatisfaction; and whilst throughout the heavenly mansions religious\nofferings fell as raining flowers, the Devas and the Nâga spirits, with\none voice, praised the Buddha’s virtues; men seeing the religious\nofferings, hearing, too, the joyous hymn of praise, were all rejoiced in\nturn; they leapt for unrestrained joy; Mâra, the Devarâga, only, felt in\nhis heart great anguish. Buddha for those seven days, in contemplation\nlost, his heart at peace, beheld and pondered on the Bodhi tree, with\ngaze unmoved and never wearying:—“Now resting here, in this condition,\nI have obtained,” he said, “my ever-shifting heart’s desire, and now at\nrest I stand, escaped from self.” The eyes of Buddha then considered\n“all that lives,” and forthwith rose there in him deep compassion; much\nhe desired to bring about their welfare, but how to gain for them that\nmost excellent deliverance, from covetous desire, hatred, ignorance, and\nfalse teaching, this was the question; how to suppress this sinful heart\nby right direction; not by anxious use of outward means, but by resting\nquietly in thoughtful silence. Now looking back and thinking of his\nmighty vow, there rose once more within his mind a wish to preach the\nlaw; and looking carefully throughout the world, he saw how pain and\nsorrow ripened and increased everywhere. Then Brahma-deva knowing his\nthoughts, and considering it right to request him to advance religion\nfor the wider spread of the Brahma-glory, in the deliverance of all\nflesh from sorrow, coming, beheld upon the person of the reverend monk\nall the distinguishing marks of a great preacher, visible in an\nexcellent degree; fixed and unmoved he sat in the possession of truth\nand wisdom, free from all evil impediments, with a heart cleansed from\nall insincerity or falsehood. Then with reverent and a joyful heart,\ngreat Brahma stood and with hands joined, thus made known his\nrequest:—“What happiness in all the world so great as when a loving\nmaster meets the unwise; the world with all its occupants, filled with\nimpurity and dire confusion, with heavy grief oppressed, or, in some\ncases, lighter sorrows, waits deliverance; the lord of men, having\nescaped by crossing the wide and mournful sea of birth and death, we now\nentreat to rescue others—those struggling creatures all engulfed\ntherein; as the just worldly man, when he gets profit, gives some rebate\nwithal. So the lord of men enjoying such religious gain, should also\ngive somewhat to living things. The world indeed is bent on large\npersonal gain, and hard it is to share one’s own with others. O! let\nyour loving heart be moved with pity towards the world burdened with\nvexing cares.” Thus having spoken by way of exhortation, with reverent\nmien he turned back to the Brahma heaven. Buddha, regarding the\ninvitation of Brahma-deva, rejoiced at heart, and his design was\nstrengthened; greatly was his heart of pity nourished, and purposed was\nhis mind to preach. Thinking he ought to beg some food, each of the four\nkings offered him a Pâtra; Tathâgata, in fealty to religion, received\nthe four and joined them all in one. And now some merchant men were\npassing by, to whom “a virtuous friend,” a heavenly spirit, said: “The\ngreat Rishi, the venerable monk, is dwelling in this mountain-grove,\naffording in the world a noble field for merit; go then and offer him a\nsacrifice!” Hearing the summons, joyfully they went, and offered the\nfirst meal religiously. Having partaken of it, then he deeply pondered,\nwho first should hear the law; he thought at once of Ârâda Kâlâma and\nUdraka Râmaputra, as being fit to accept the righteous law; but now they\nboth were dead. Then next he thought of the five men, that they were fit\nto hear the first sermon. Bent then on this design to preach Nirvâna, as\nthe sun’s glory bursts through the darkness, so went he on towards\nBenares, the place where dwelt the ancient Rishis. With eyes as gentle\nas the ox king’s, his pace as firm and even as the lion’s, because he\nwould convert the world he went on towards the Kâsi city. Step by step,\nlike the king of beasts, did he advance watchfully through the grove of\nwisdom.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iii/turning-the-law-wheel/\">Turning the Law-wheel</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>The six organs of sense.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bodhisattva having subdued Mâra, his firmly fixed mind at rest,\nthoroughly exhausting the first principle of truth, he entered into deep\nand subtle contemplation.
