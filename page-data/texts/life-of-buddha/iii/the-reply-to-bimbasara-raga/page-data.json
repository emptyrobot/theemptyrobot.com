Your words are not opposed to reason, descendant of a\ndistinguished family—an Aryan—amongst men a true friend indeed,\nrighteous and sincere to the bottom of your heart, it is proper for\nreligion’s sake to speak thus. In all the world, in its different\nsections, there is no chartered place for solid virtue, for if virtue\nflags and folly rules, what reverence can there be, or honor paid, to a\nhigh name or boast of prowess, inherited from former generations! And so\nthere may be in the midst of great distress, large goodness, these are\nnot mutually opposed. This then is so with the world in the connection\nof true worth and friendship. A true friend who makes good use of\nwealth—is rightly called a fast and firm treasure, but he who guards\nand stints the profit he has made, his wealth will soon be spent and\nlost; the wealth of a country is no constant treasure, but that which is\ngiven in charity is rich in returns, therefore charity is a true friend:\nalthough it scatters, yet it brings no repentance; you indeed are known\nas liberal and kind, I make no reply in opposition to you, but simply as\nwe meet, so with agreeable purpose we talk. I fear birth, old age,\ndisease, and death, and so I seek to find a sure mode of deliverance; I\nhave put away thought of relatives and family affection, how is it\npossible then for me to return to the world and not to fear to revive\nthe poisonous snake, and after the hail to be burned in the fierce fire;\nindeed, I fear the objects of these several desires, this whirling in\nthe stream of life troubles my heart, these five desires, the inconstant\nthieves—stealing from men their choicest treasures, making them unreal,\nfalse, and fickle—are like the man called up as an apparition; for a\ntime the beholders are affected by it, but it has no lasting hold upon\nthe mind; so these five desires are the great obstacles, forever\ndisarranging the way of peace; if the joys of heaven are not worth\nhaving, how much less the desires common to men, begetting the thirst of\nwild love, and then lost in the enjoyment, as the fierce wind fans the\nfire, till the fuel be spent and the fire expires; of all unrighteous\nthings in the world, there is nothing worse than the domain of the five\ndesires; for all men maddened by the power of lust, giving themselves to\npleasure, are dead to reason. The wise man fears these desires, he fears\nto fall into the way of unrighteousness; for like a king who rules all\nwithin the four seas, yet still seeks beyond for something more, so is\nlust; like the unbounded ocean, it knows not when and where to stop.\nMandha, the Kakravartin, when the heavens rained yellow gold, and he\nruled all within the seas, yet sighed after the domain of the\nthirty-three heavens; dividing with Sakra his seat, and so through the\npower of this lust he died; Nung-Sha, whilst practising austerities, got\npower to rule the thirty-three heavenly abodes, but from lust he became\nproud and supercilious; the Rishi whilst stepping into his chariot,\nthrough carelessness in his gait, fell down into the midst of the\nserpent pit. Yen-lo, the universal monarch (Kakravartin), wandering\nabroad through the Trayastrimsas heaven, took a heavenly woman (Apsara)\nfor a queen, and unjustly extorted the gold of a Rishi; the Rishi, in\nanger, added a charm, by which the country was ruined, and his life\nended. Po-lo, and Sakra king of Devas, and Nung-Sha returning to Sakra;\nwhat certainty is there, even for the lord of heaven? Neither is any\ncountry safe, though kept by the mighty strength of those dwelling in\nit. But when one’s clothing consists of grass, the berries one’s food,\nthe rivulets one’s drink, with long hair flowing to the ground, silent\nas a Muni, seeking nothing, in this way practising austerities, in the\nend lust shall be destroyed. Know then, that the province of the five\ndesires is avowedly an enemy of the religious man. Even the\none-thousand-armed invincible king, strong in his might, finds it hard\nto conquer this. The Rishi Râma perished because of lust; how much more\nought I, the son of a Kshatriya, to restrain lustful desire; but indulge\nin lust a little, and like the child it grows apace, the wise man hates\nit therefore; who would take poison for food? every sorrow is increased\nand cherished by the offices of lust. If there is no lustful desire, the\nrisings of sorrow are not produced, the wise man seeing the bitterness\nof sorrow, stamps out and destroys the risings of desire; that which the\nworld calls virtue, is but another form of this baneful law; worldly men\nenjoying the pleasure of covetous desire then every form of careless\nconduct results; these careless ways producing hurt, at death, the\nsubject of them reaps perdition. But by the diligent use of means, and\ncareful continuance therein, the consequences of negligence are avoided,\nwe should therefore dread the non-use of means; recollecting that all\nthings are illusory, the wise man covets them not; he who desires such\nthings, desires sorrow, and then goes on again ensnared in love, with no\ncertainty of ultimate freedom; he advances still and ever adds grief to\ngrief, like one holding a lighted torch burns his hand, and therefore\nthe wise man enters on no such things. The foolish man and the one who\ndoubts, still encouraging the covetous and burning heart, in the end\nreceives accumulated sorrow, not to be remedied by any prospect of rest;\ncovetousness and anger are as the serpent’s poison; the wise man casts\naway the approach of sorrow as a rotten bone; he tastes it not nor\ntouches it, lest it should corrupt his teeth, that which the wise man\nwill not take, the king will go through fire and water to obtain, the\nwicked sons labor for wealth as for a piece of putrid flesh, o’er which\nthe hungry flocks of birds contend. So should we regard riches; the wise\nman is ill pleased at having wealth stored up, the mind wild with\nanxious thoughts, guarding himself by night and day, as a man who fears\nsome powerful enemy, like as a man’s feelings revolt with disgust at the\nsights seen beneath the slaughter post of the East Market; so the high\npost which marks the presence of lust, and anger, and ignorance, the\nwise man always avoids; as those who enter the mountains or the seas\nhave much to contend with and little rest, as the fruit which grows on a\nhigh tree, and is grasped at by the covetous at the risk of life, so is\nthe region of covetous desire, though they see the difficulty of getting\nit, yet how painfully do men scheme after wealth, difficult to acquire,\neasy to dissipate, as that which is got in a dream: how can the wise man\nhoard up such trash! Like covering over with a false surface a hole full\nof fire, slipping through which the body is burnt, so is the fire of\ncovetous desire. The wise man meddles not with it. Like that Kaurava, or\nPih-se-ni Nanda, or Ni-k’he-lai Danta, as some butcher’s appearance,\nsuch also is the appearance of lustful desire; the wise man will have\nnothing to do with it; he would rather throw his body into the water or\nfire, or cast himself down over a steep precipice. Seeking to obtain\nheavenly pleasures, what is this but to remove the place of sorrow,\nwithout profit. Sün-tau, Po-sun-tau, brothers of Asura, lived together\nin great affection, but on account of lustful desire slew one another,\nand their name perished; all this then comes from lust; it is this which\nmakes a man vile, and lashes and goads him with piercing sorrow; lust\ndebases a man, robs him of all hope, whilst through the long night his\nbody and soul are worn out; like the stag that covets the power of\nspeech and dies, or the winged bird that covets sensual pleasure, or the\nfish that covets the baited hook, such are the calamities that lust\nbrings; considering what are the requirements of life, none of these\npossess permanency; we eat to appease the pain of hunger, to do away\nwith thirst we drink, we clothe ourselves to keep out the cold and wind,\nwe lie down to rest to get sleep, to procure locomotion we seek a\ncarriage, when we would halt we seek a seat, we wash to cleanse\nourselves from dirt; all these things are done to avoid inconvenience;\nwe may gather therefore that these five desires have no permanent\ncharacter; for as a man suffering from fever seeks and asks for some\ncooling medicine, so covetousness seeks for something to satisfy its\nlongings; foolish men regard these things as permanent, and as the\nnecessary requirements of life, but, in sooth, there is no permanent\ncessation of sorrow; for by coveting to appease these desires we really\nincrease them; there is no character of permanency therefore about them.\nTo be filled and clothed are no lasting pleasures, time passes, and the\nsorrow recurs; summer is cool during the moon-tide shining; winter comes\nand cold increases; and so through all the eightfold laws of the world\nthey possess no marks of permanence, sorrow and joy cannot agree\ntogether, as a person slave-governed loses his renown. But religion\ncauses all things to be of service, as a king reigning in his\nsovereignty; so religion controls sorrow, as one fits on a burden\naccording to power of endurance. Whatever our condition in the world,\nstill sorrows accumulate around us. Even in the condition of a king, how\ndoes pain multiply, though bound to others by love, yet this is a cause\nof grief; without friends and living alone, what joy can there be in\nthis? Though a man rules over the four kingdoms, yet only one part can\nbe enjoyed; to be concerned in ten thousand matters, what profit is\nthere in this, for we only accumulate anxieties. Put an end to sorrow,\nthen, by appeasing desire, refrain from busy work, this is rest. A king\nenjoys his sensual pleasures; deprived of kingship there is the joy of\nrest; in both cases there are pleasures but of different kinds; why then\nbe a king! Make then no plan or crafty expedient, to lead me back to the\nfive desires; what my heart prays for, is some quiet place and freedom;\nbut you desire to entangle me in relationships and duties, and destroy\nthe completion of what I seek; I am in no fear of family hatred, nor do\nI seek the joys of heaven; my heart hankers after no vulgar profit, so I\nhave put away my royal diadem; and contrary to your way of thinking, I\nprefer, henceforth, no more to rule. A hare rescued from the serpent’s\nmouth, would it go back again to be devoured? holding a torch and\nburning himself, would not a man let it go? A man blind and recovering\nhis sight, would he again seek to be in darkness? the rich, does he sigh\nfor poverty? the wise, does he long to be ignorant? Has the world such\nmen as these? then will I again enjoy my country. But I desire to get\nrid of birth, old age, and death, with body restrained, to beg my food;\nwith appetites moderated, to keep in my retreat; and then to avoid the\nevil modes of a future life, this is to find peace in two worlds: now\nthen I pray you pity me not. Pity, rather, those who rule as kings!\ntheir souls ever vacant and athirst, in the present world no repose,\nhereafter receiving pain as their meed. You, who possess a distinguished\nfamily name, and the reverence due to a great master, would generously\nshare your dignity with me, your worldly pleasures and amusements; I,\ntoo, in return, for your sake, beseech you to share my reward with me;\nhe who indulges in the threefold kinds of pleasure, this man the world\ncalls ‘Lord,’ but this is not according to reason either, because these\nthings cannot be retained, but where there is no birth, or life, or\ndeath, he who exercises himself in this way, is Lord indeed! You say\nthat while young a man should be gay, and when old then religious, but I\nregard the feebleness of age as bringing with it loss of power to be\nreligious, unlike the firmness and power of youth, the will determined\nand the heart established; but death as a robber with a drawn sword\nfollows us all, desiring to catch his prey; how then should we wait for\nold age, ere we bring our mind to a religious life? Inconstancy is the\ngreat hunter, age his bow, disease his arrows, in the fields of life and\ndeath he hunts for living things as for the deer; when he can get his\nopportunity, he takes our life; who then would wait for age? And what\nthe teachers say and do, with reference to matters connected with life\nand death, exhorting the young, mature, or middle-aged, all to contrive\nby any means, to prepare vast meetings for sacrifices, this they do\nindeed of their own ignorance; better far to reverence the true law, and\nput an end to sacrifice to appease the gods! Destroying life to gain\nreligious merit, what love can such a man possess? even if the reward of\nsuch sacrifices were lasting, even for this, slaughter would be\nunseemly; how much more, when the reward is transient! Shall we, in\nsearch of this, slay that which lives, in worship? this is like those\nwho practise wisdom, and the way of religious abstraction, but neglect\nthe rules of moral conduct. It ill behooves us then to follow with the\nworld, and attend these sacrificial assemblies, and seek some present\ngood in killing that which lives; the wise avoid destroying life! Much\nless do they engage in general sacrifices, for the purpose of gaining\nfuture reward! the fruit promised in the three worlds is none of mine to\nchoose for happiness! All these are governed by transient, fickle laws,\nlike the wind, or the drop that is blown from the grass; such things\ntherefore I put away from me, and I seek for true escape. I hear there\nis one O-lo-lam who eloquently discourses on the way of escape; I must\ngo to the place where he dwells, that great Rishi and hermit. But in\ntruth, sorrow must be banished; I regret indeed leaving you; may your\ncountry have repose and quiet! safely defended by you as by the divine\nSakra râga! May wisdom be shed abroad as light upon your empire, like\nthe brightness of the meridian sun! may you be exceedingly victorious as\nlord of the great earth, with a perfect heart ruling over its destiny!\nMay you direct and defend its sons! ruling your empire in righteousness!\nWater and snow and fire are opposed to one another, but the fire by its\ninfluence causes vapor, the vapor causes the floating clouds, the\nfloating clouds drop down rain; there are birds in space, who drink the\nrain, with rainless bodies.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> Slaughter and peaceful homes are\nenemies! those who would have peace hate slaughter, and if those who\nslaughter are so hateful, then put an end, O king, to those who practise\nit!
