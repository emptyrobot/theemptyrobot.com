Beside the way he encountered a young Brahman\nwhose name was Upâka; struck with the deportment of the Bhikshu, he\nstood with reverent mien on the roadside. Joyously he gazed at such an\nunprecedented sight, and then, with closed hands, he spake as\nfollows:—“The crowds who live around are stained with sin, without a\npleasing feature, void of grace, and the great world’s heart is\neverywhere disturbed; but you alone, your senses all composed, with\nvisage shining as the moon when full, seem to have quaffed the water of\nthe immortals’ stream. The marks of beauty yours, as the great man’s,\nthe strength of wisdom, as an all-sufficient, independent king’s; what\nyou have done must have been wisely done: what then your noble tribe and\nwho your master?” Answering he said, “I have no master; no honorable\ntribe; no point of excellence; self-taught in this profoundest doctrine,\nI have arrived at superhuman wisdom. That which behooves the world to\nlearn, but through the world no learner found, I now myself and by\nmyself have learned throughout; ‘tis rightly called Sambodhi. That\nhateful family of griefs the sword of wisdom has destroyed; this then is\nwhat the world has named, and rightly named, the ‘chiefest victory.’\nThrough all Benares soon will sound the drum of life, no stay is\npossible—I have no name—nor do I seek profit or pleasure. But simply\nto declare the truth; to save men from pain, and to fulfil my ancient\noath, to rescue all not yet delivered. The fruit of this my oath is\nripened now, and I will follow out my ancient vow. Wealth, riches, self\nall given up, unnamed, I still am named ‘Righteous Master.’ And bringing\nprofit to the world, I also have the name ‘Great Teacher’; facing\nsorrows, not swallowed up by them, am I not rightly called ‘Courageous\nWarrior?’ If not a healer of diseases, what means the name of ‘Good\nPhysician?’ Seeing the wanderer, not showing him the way, why then\nshould I be called ‘Good Master-guide?’ Like as the lamp shines in the\ndark, without a purpose of its own, self-radiant, so burns the lamp of\nthe Tathâgata, without the shadow of a personal feeling. Bore wood in\nwood, there must be fire; the wind blows of its own free self in space;\ndig deep and you will come to water; this is the rule of self-causation.\nAll the Munis who perfect wisdom, must do so at Gayâ; and in the Kâsi\ncountry they must first turn the Wheel of Righteousness.” The young\nBrahman Upâka, astonished, breathed the praise of such strange doctrine,\nand called to mind like thoughts he had before experienced; lost in\nthought at the wonderful occurrence, at every turning of the road he\nstopped to think; embarrassed in every step he took, Tathâgata\nproceeding slowly onwards, came to the city of Kâsi. The land so\nexcellently adorned as the palace of Sakradevendra; the Ganges and\nBaranâ, two twin rivers flowed amidst; the woods and flowers and fruits\nso verdant, the peaceful cattle wandering together, the calm retreats\nfree from vulgar noise, such was the place where the old Rishis dwelt.\nTathâgata, glorious and radiant, redoubled the brightness of the place;\nthe son of the Kaundinya tribe, and next Dasabalakâsyapa, and the third\nVâshpa, the fourth Asvagit, the fifth called Bhadra, practising\nausterities as hermits, seeing from far Tathâgata approaching, sitting\ntogether all engaged in conversation, said: “This Gautama, defiled by\nworldly indulgence, leaving the practice of austerities, now comes again\nto find us here, let us be careful not to rise in salutation, nor let us\ngreet him when he comes, nor offer him the customary refreshments.\nBecause he has broken his first vow, he has no claim to\nhospitality”—for men on seeing an approaching guest by rights prepare\nthings for his present and his after wants. They arrange a proper\nresting-couch, and take on themselves care for his comfort. Having\nspoken thus and so agreed, each kept his seat, resolved and fixed. And\nnow Tathâgata slowly approached, when, lo! these men unconsciously,\nagainst their vow, rose and invited him to take a seat; offering to take\nhis robe and Pâtra. They begged to wash and rub his feet, and asked him\nwhat he required more; thus in everything attentive, they honored him\nand offered all to him as teacher. They did not cease however to address\nhim still as Gautama, after his family. Then spake the Lord to them and\nsaid: “Call me not after my private name, for it is a rude and careless\nway of speaking to one who has obtained Arhat-ship; but whether men\nrespect or disrespect me, my mind is undisturbed and wholly quiet. But\nyou—your way is not so courteous: let go, I pray, and cast away your\nfault. Buddha can save the world; they call him, therefore, Buddha.\nTowards all living things, with equal heart he looks as children, to\ncall him then by his familiar name is to despise a father; this is sin.”\nThus Buddha, by exercise of mighty love, in deep compassion spoke to\nthem; but they, from ignorance and pride, despised the only wise and\ntrue one’s words. They said that first he practised self-denial, but\nhaving reached thereby no profit, now giving rein to body, word, and\nthought, how by these means, they asked, has he become a Buddha? Thus\nequally entangled by doubts, they would not credit that he had attained\nthe way. Thoroughly versed in highest truth, full of all-embracing\nwisdom, Tagâgata on their account briefly declared to them the one true\nway; the foolish masters practising austerities, and those who love to\ngratify their senses, he pointed out to them these two distinctive\nclasses, and how both greatly erred. “Neither of these,” he said, “has\nfound the way of highest wisdom, nor are their ways of life productive\nof true rescue. The emaciated devotee by suffering produces in himself\nconfused and sickly thoughts, not conducive even to worldly knowledge,\nhow much less to triumph over sense! For he who tries to light a lamp\nwith water, will not succeed in scattering the darkness, and so the man\nwho tries with worn-out body to trim the lamp of wisdom shall not\nsucceed, nor yet destroy his ignorance or folly. Who seeks with rotten\nwood to evoke the fire will waste his labor and get nothing for it; but\nboring hard wood into hard, the man of skill forthwith gets fire for his\nuse. In seeking wisdom then it is not by these austerities a man may\nreach the law of life. But to indulge in pleasure is opposed to right:\nthis is the fool’s barrier against wisdom’s light. The sensualist cannot\ncomprehend the Sûtras or the Sâstras, how much less the way of\novercoming all desire! As some man grievously afflicted eats food not\nfit to eat, and so in ignorance aggravates his sickness, so can he get\nrid of lust who pampers lust? Scatter the fire amid the desert grass,\ndried by the sun, fanned by the wind—the raging flames who shall\nextinguish? Such is the fire of covetousness and lust. I, then, reject\nboth these extremes: my heart keeps in the middle way. All sorrow at an\nend and finished, I rest at peace, all error put away; my true sight\ngreater than the glory of the sun, my equal and unvarying wisdom,\nvehicle of insight—right words as it were a dwelling-place—wandering\nthrough the pleasant groves of right conduct, making a right life my\nrecreation, walking along the right road of proper means, my city of\nrefuge in right recollection, and my sleeping couch right meditation;\nthese are the eight even and level roads by which to avoid the sorrows\nof birth and death. Those who come forth by these means from the slough,\ndoing thus, have attained the end; such shall fall neither on this side\nor the other, amidst the sorrow-crowd of the two periods. The tangled\nsorrow-web of the three worlds by this road alone can be destroyed; this\nis my own way, unheard of before; by the pure eyes of the true law,\nimpartially seeing the way of escape, I, only I, now first make known\nthis way; thus I destroy the hateful company of Trishnâ’s host, the\nsorrows of birth and death, old age, disease, and all the unfruitful\naims of men, and other springs of suffering. There are those who warring\nagainst desire are still influenced by desire; who whilst possessed of\nbody, act as though they had none; who put away from themselves all\nsources of true merit—briefly will I recount their sorrowful lot. Like\nsmothering a raging fire, though carefully put out, yet a spark left, so\nin their abstraction, still the germ of ‘I,’ the source of great sorrow\nstill surviving, perpetuates the suffering caused by lust, and the evil\nconsequences of every kind of deed survive. These are the sources of\nfurther pain, but let these go and sorrow dies, even as the seed of corn\ntaken from the earth and deprived of water dies; the concurrent causes\nnot uniting, then the bud and leaf cannot be born; the intricate bonds\nof every kind of existence, from the Deva down to the evil ways of\nbirth, ever revolve and never cease; all this is produced from covetous\ndesire; falling from a high estate to lower ones, all is the fault of\nprevious deeds. But destroy the seed of covetousness and the rest, then\nthere will be no intricate binding, but all effect of deeds destroyed,\nthe various degrees of sorrow then will end for good. Having this, then,\nwe must inherit that; destroying this, then that is ended too; no birth,\nold age, disease, or death; no earth, or water, fire, or wind. No\nbeginning, end, or middle; and no deceptive systems of philosophy; this\nis the standpoint of wise men and sages; the certain and exhausted\ntermination, complete Nirvâna. Such do the eight right ways declare;\nthis one expedient has no remains; that which the world sees not,\nengrossed by error I declare, I know the way to sever all these\nsorrow-sources; the way to end them is by right reason, meditating on\nthese four highest truths, following and perfecting this highest wisdom.\nThis is what means the ‘knowing’ sorrow; this is to cut off the cause of\nall remains of being; these destroyed, then all striving, too, has\nended, the eight right ways have been assayed.</p>\n<p>“Thus, too, the four great truths have been acquired, the eyes of the\npure law completed. In these four truths, the equal, true or right, eyes\nnot yet born, there is not mention made of gaining true deliverance; it\nis not said what must be done is done, nor that all is finished, nor\nthat the perfect truth has been acquired. But now because the truth is\nknown, then by myself is known ‘deliverance gained,’ by myself is known\nthat ‘all is done,’ by myself is known ‘the highest wisdom.‘” And having\nspoken thus respecting truth, the member of the Kaundinya family, and\neighty thousand of the Deva host, were thoroughly imbued with saving\nknowledge. They put away defilement from themselves, they got the eyes\nof the pure law; Devas and earthly masters thus were sure, that what was\nto be done was done. And now with lion-voice he joyfully inquired, and\nasked Kaundinya, “Knowest thou yet?” Kaundinya forthwith answered\nBuddha, “I know the mighty master’s law.” And for this reason, knowing\nit, his name was Âgnâta Kaundinya. Amongst all the disciples of Buddha,\nhe was the very first in understanding. Then as he understood the sounds\nof the true law, hearing the words of the disciple—all the earth\nspirits together raised a shout triumphant, “Well done! deeply seeing\nthe principles of the law, Tathâgata, on this auspicious day, has set\nrevolving that which never yet revolved, and far and wide, for gods and\nmen, has opened the gates of immortality. Of this wheel the spokes are\nthe rules of pure conduct; equal contemplation, their uniformity of\nlength; firm wisdom is the tire; modesty and thoughtfulness, the rubbers\n(sockets in the nave in which the axle is fixed); right reflection is\nthe nave; the wheel itself the law of perfect truth; the right truth now\nhas gone forth in the world, not to retire before another teacher.”</p>\n<p>Thus the earth spirits shouted, the spirits of the air took up the\nstrain, the Devas all joined in the hymn of praise, up to the highest\nBrahma heaven. The Devas of the triple world, now hearing what the great\nRishi taught, in intercourse together spoke, “The widely honored Buddha\nmoves the world! Widespread, for the sake of all that lives, he turns\nthe wheel of the law of complete purity!” The stormy winds, the clouds,\nthe mists, all disappeared; down from space the heavenly flowers\ndescended. The Devas revelled in their joys celestial, filled with\nunutterable gladness.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/bimbisara-raga-becomes-a-disciple/\">Bimbisâra Râga Becomes a Disciple</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tathâgata piously composed and silent, radiant with glory, shedding\nlight around, with unmatched dignity advanced alone, as if surrounded by\na crowd of followers.
