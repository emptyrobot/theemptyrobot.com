Approaching one another, they made mutual inquiries; and\nthis being done, with the usual apologies, according to their precedence\nin age they sat down; the Brahmakârins observing the prince, beheld his\npersonal beauty and carefully considered his appearance; respectfully\nthey satisfied themselves of his high qualities, like those who,\nthirsty, drink the “pure dew.” Then with raised hands they addressed the\nprince: “Have you been long an ascetic, divided from your family and\nbroken from the bonds of love, like the elephant who has cast off\nrestraint? Full of wisdom, completely enlightened, you seem well able to\nescape the poisonous fruit of this world. In old time the monarch Ming\nShing gave up his kingly estate to his son, as a man who has carried a\nflowery wreath, when withered casts it away: but such is not your case,\nfull of youthful vigor, and yet not enamoured with the condition of a\nholy king; we see that your will is strong and fixed, capable of\nbecoming a vessel of the true law, able to embark in the boat of wisdom,\nand to cross over the sea of life and death. The common class, enticed\nto come to learn, their talents first are tested, then they are taught;\nbut as I understand your case, your mind is already fixed and your will\nfirm; and now you have undertaken the purpose of learning, I am\npersuaded you will not in the end shrink from it.”</p>\n<p>The prince hearing this exhortation, with gladness made reply: “You have\nwith equal intention, illustrious! cautioned me with impartial mind;\nwith humble heart I accept the advice, and pray that it may be so with\nme as you anticipate; that I may in my night-journey obtain a torch, to\nguide me safely through treacherous places; a handy boat to cross over\nthe sea;—may it be so even now with me! But as I am somewhat in doubt\nand anxious to learn, I will venture to make known my doubts, and ask,\nwith respect to old age, disease, and death, how are these things to be\nescaped?”</p>\n<p>At this time O-lo-lam hearing the question asked by the prince, briefly\nfrom the various Sutras and Sâstras quoted passages in explanation of a\nway of deliverance. “But thou,” he said, “illustrious youth! so highly\ngifted, and eminent among the wise! hear what I have to say, as I\ndiscourse upon the mode of ending birth and death; nature, and change,\nbirth, old age, and death, these five attributes belong to all; nature\nis (in itself) pure and without fault; the involution of this with the\nfive elements, causes an awakening and power of perception, which,\naccording to its exercise, is the cause of change; form, sound, order,\ntaste, touch, these are called the five objects of sense; as the hand\nand foot are called the two ways, so these are called the roots of\naction (the five skandhas); the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the\nbody, these are named the roots (instruments) of understanding. The root\nof mind (manas) is twofold, being both material, and also intelligent;\nnature by its involutions is the cause, the knower of the cause is I\n(the soul); Kapila the Rishi and his numerous followers, on this deep\nprinciple of soul, practising wisdom (Buddhi), found deliverance. Kapila\nand now Vâkaspati, by the power of Buddhi perceiving the character of\nbirth, old age, and death, declare that on this is founded true\nphilosophy; whilst all opposed to this, they say, is false. Ignorance\nand passion, causing constant transmigration, abiding in the midst of\nthese (they say) is the lot of all that lives. Doubting the truth of\nsoul is called excessive doubt, and without distinguishing aright, there\ncan be no method of escape. Deep speculation as to the limits of\nperception is but to involve the soul; thus unbelief leads to confusion,\nand ends in differences of thought and conduct. Again, the various\nspeculations on soul, such as ‘I say,’ ‘I know and perceive,’ ‘I come’\nand ‘I go,’ or ‘I remain fixed,’ these are called the intricacies of\nsoul. And then the fancies raised in different natures, some saying\n‘this is so,’ others denying it, and this condition of uncertainty is\ncalled the state of darkness. Then there are those who say that outward\nthings are one with soul, who say that the objective is the same as\nmind, who confuse intelligence with instruments, who say that number is\nthe soul. Thus not distinguishing aright, these are called excessive\nquibbles, marks of folly, nature changes, and so on. To worship and\nrecite religious books, to slaughter living things in sacrifice, to\nrender pure by fire and water, and thus awake the thought of final\nrescue, all these ways of thinking are called without right expedient,\nthe result of ignorance and doubt, by means of word or thought or deed;\ninvolving outward relationships, this is called depending on means;\nmaking the material world the ground of soul, this is called depending\non the senses. By these eight sorts of speculation are we involved in\nbirth and death. The foolish masters of the world make their\nclassifications in these five ways: Darkness, folly, and great folly,\nangry passion, with timid fear. Indolent coldness is called darkness;\nbirth and death are called folly; lustful desire is great folly; because\nof great men subjected to error, cherishing angry feelings, passion\nresults; trepidation of the heart is called fear. Thus these foolish men\ndilate upon the five desires; but the root of the great sorrow of birth\nand death, the life destined to be spent in the five ways, the cause of\nthe whirl of life, I clearly perceive, is to be placed in the existence\nof ‘I’; because of the influence of this cause, result the consequences\nof repeated birth and death; this cause is without any nature of its\nown, and its fruits have no nature; rightly considering what has been\nsaid, there are four matters which have to do with escape, kindling\nwisdom—opposed to dark ignorance—making manifest—opposed to\nconcealment and obscurity—if these four matters be understood, then we\nmay escape birth, old age, and death. Birth, old age, and death being\nover, then we attain a final place; the Brahmans all depending on this\nprinciple, practising themselves in a pure life, have also largely\ndilated on it, for the good of the world.”</p>\n<p>The prince hearing these words again inquired of Ârâda: “Tell me what\nare the expedients you name, and what is the final place to which they\nlead, and what is the character of that pure Brahman life; and again\nwhat are the stated periods during which such life must be practised,\nand during which such life is lawful; all these are principles to be\ninquired into; and on them I pray you discourse for my sake.”</p>\n<p>Then that Ârâda, according to the Sutras and Sâstras, spoke: “Yourself\nusing wisdom is the expedient; but I will further dilate on this a\nlittle; first by removing from the crowd and leading a hermit’s life,\ndepending entirely on alms for food, extensively practising rules of\ndecorum, religiously adhering to right rules of conduct; desiring little\nand knowing when to abstain, receiving whatever is given in food,\nwhether pleasant or otherwise, delighting to practise a quiet life,\ndiligently studying all the Sûtras and Sâstras; observing the character\nof covetous longing and fear, without remnant of desire to live in\npurity, to govern well the organs of life, the mind quieted and silently\nat rest; removing desire, and hating vice, all the sorrows of life put\naway, then there is happiness; and we obtain the enjoyment of the first\ndhyâna.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> Having obtained this first dhyâna, then with the\nillumination thus obtained, by inward meditation is born reliance on\nthought alone, and the entanglements of folly are put away; the mind\ndepending on this, then after death, born in the Brahma heavens, the\nenlightened are able to know themselves; by the use of means is produced\nfurther inward illumination; diligently persevering, seeking higher\nadvance, accomplishing the second dhyâna, tasting of that great joy, we\nare born in the Kwong-yin heaven; then by the use of means putting away\nthis delight, practising the third dhyâna, resting in such delight and\nwishing no further excellence, there is a birth in the Subhakritsna\nheaven; leaving the thought of such delight, straightway we reach the\nfourth dhyâna, all joys and sorrows done away, the thought of escape\nproduced; we dwell in this fourth dhyâna, and are born in the\nVrihat-phala heaven; because of its long enduring years, it is thus\ncalled Vrihat-phala (extensive-fruit); whilst in that state of\nabstraction rising higher, perceiving there is a place beyond any bodily\ncondition, adding still and persevering further in practising wisdom,\nrejecting this fourth dhyâna, firmly resolved to persevere in the\nsearch, still contriving to put away every desire after form, gradually\nfrom every pore of the body there is perceived a feeling of empty\nrelease, and in the end this extends to every solid part, so that the\nwhole is perfected in an apprehension of emptiness. In brief, perceiving\nno limits to this emptiness, there is opened to the view boundless\nknowledge. Endowed with inward rest and peace, the idea of ‘I’ departs,\nand the object of ‘I’—clearly discriminating the non-existence of\nmatter, this is the condition of immaterial life. As the Muñga (grass)\nwhen freed from its horny case, or as the wild bird which escapes from\nits prison trap, so, getting away from all material limitations, we thus\nfind perfect release. Thus ascending above the Brahmans, deprived of\nevery vestige of bodily existence, we still endure. Endued with wisdom!\nlet it be known this is real and true deliverance. You ask what are the\nexpedients for obtaining this escape; even as I have before detailed,\nthose who have deep faith will learn. The Rishis Gaigîshavya, Ganaka,\nVriddha Parâsara, and other searchers after truth, all by the way I have\nexplained, have reached true deliverance.”</p>\n<p>The prince hearing these words, deeply pondering on the outline of these\nprinciples, and reaching back to the influences produced by our former\nlives, again asked with further words: “I have heard your very excellent\nsystem of wisdom, the principles very subtle and deep-reaching, from\nwhich I learn that because of not ‘letting go’ (by knowledge as a\ncause), we do not reach the end of the religious life; but by\nunderstanding nature in its involutions, then, you say, we obtain\ndeliverance; I perceive this law of birth has also concealed in it\nanother law as a germ; you say that the ‘I’ (i.e. the soul of Kapila)\nbeing rendered pure, forthwith there is true deliverance; but if we\nencounter a union of cause and effect, then there is a return to the\ntrammels of birth; just as the germ in the seed, when earth, fire,\nwater, and wind seem to have destroyed in it the principle of life,\nmeeting with favorable concomitant circumstances will yet revive,\nwithout any evident cause, but because of desire; so those who have\ngained this supposed release, likewise keeping the idea of ‘I’ and\nliving things, have in fact gained no final deliverance; in every\ncondition, letting go the three classes and again reaching the three\nexcellent qualities, because of the eternal existence of soul, by the\nsubtle influences of that (influences resulting from the past), the\nheart lets go the idea of expedients, and obtains an almost endless\nduration of years. This, you say, is true release; you say ‘letting go\nthe ground on which the idea of soul rests,’ that this frees us from\n‘limited existence,’ and that the mass of people have not yet removed\nthe idea of soul, and are therefore still in bondage. But what is this\nletting go gunas (cords fettering the soul); if one is fettered by these\ngunas, how can there be release? For gunî (the object) and guna (the\nquality) in idea are different, but in substance one; if you say that\nyou can remove the properties of a thing and leave the thing by arguing\nit to the end, this is not so. If you remove heat from fire, then there\nis no such thing as fire, or if you remove surface from body, what body\ncan remain? Thus guna is as it were surface, remove this and there can\nbe no gunî. So that this deliverance, spoken of before, must leave a\nbody yet in bonds. Again, you say that by clear knowledge you get rid of\nbody; there is then such a thing as knowledge or the contrary; if you\naffirm the existence of clear knowledge, then there should be someone\nwho possesses it (i.e. possesses this knowledge); if there be a\npossesor, how can there be deliverance from this personal ‘I’? If you\nsay there is no ‘knower,’ then who is it that is spoken of as ‘knowing’?\nIf there is knowledge and no person, then the subject of knowledge may\nbe a stone or a log; moreover, to have clear knowledge of these minute\ncauses of contamination and reject them thoroughly, these being so\nrejected, there must be an end, then, of the ‘doer.’ What Ârâda has\ndeclared cannot satisfy my heart. This clear knowledge is not universal\nwisdom, I must go on and seek a better explanation.”</p>\n<p>Going on then to the place of Udra Rishi, he also expatiated on this\nquestion of “I.” But although he refined the matter to the utmost,\nlaying down a term of “thought” and “no thought” taking the position of\nremoving “thought” and “no thought,” yet even so he came not out of the\nmire; for supposing creatures attained that state, still (he said) there\nis a possibility of returning to the coil, whilst Bodhisattva sought a\nmethod of getting out of it. So once more leaving Udra Rishi, he went on\nin search of a better system, and came at last to Mount Kia-ke (the\nforest of mortification), where was a town called Pain-suffering forest.\nHere the five Bhikshus had gone before. When then he beheld these five,\nvirtuously keeping in check their senses, holding to the rules of moral\nconduct, practising mortification, dwelling in that grove of\nmortification; occupying a spot beside the Nairañgana river, perfectly\ncomposed and filled with contentment, Bodhisattva forthwith by them\nselecting one spot, quietly gave himself to thought. The five Bhikshus\nknowing him with earnest heart to be seeking escape, offered him their\nservices with devotion, as if reverencing Isvara Deva.</p>\n<p>Having finished their attentions and dutiful services, then going on he\ntook his seat not far off, as one about to enter on a course of\nreligious practice, composing all his members as he desired. Bodhisattva\ndiligently applied himself to “means,” as one about to cross over old\nage, disease, and death. With full purpose of heart he set himself to\nendure mortification, to restrain every bodily passion, and give up\nthought about sustenance, with purity of heart to observe the\nfast-rules, which no worldly man can bear; silent and still, lost in\nthoughtful meditation; and so for six years he continued, each day\neating one hemp grain, his bodily form shrunken and attenuated, seeking\nhow to cross the sea of birth and death, exercising himself still deeper\nand advancing further; making his way perfect by the disentanglements of\ntrue wisdom, not eating, and yet not looking to that as a cause of\nemancipation, his four members although exceedingly weak, his heart of\nwisdom increasing yet more and more in light; his spirit free, his body\nlight and refined, his name spreading far and wide, as “highly gifted,”\neven as the moon when first produced, or as the Kumuda flower spreading\nout its sweetness. Everywhere through the country his excellent fame\nextended; the daughters of the lord of the place both coming to see him,\nhis mortified body like a withered branch, just completing the period of\nsix years, fearing the sorrow of birth and death, seeking earnestly the\nmethod of true wisdom, he came to the conviction that these were not the\nmeans to extinguish desire and produce ecstatic contemplation; nor yet\nthe means by which in former time, seated underneath the Gambu tree, he\narrived at that miraculous condition, that surely was the proper way, he\nthought, the way opposed to this of “withered body.”</p>\n<p>“I should therefore rather seek strength of body, by drink and food\nrefresh my members, and with contentment cause my mind to rest. My mind\nat rest, I shall enjoy silent composure; composure is the trap for\ngetting ecstasy (dhyâna); while in ecstasy perceiving the true law, then\nthe force of truth obtained, disentanglement will follow. And thus\ncomposed, enjoying perfect quiet, old age and death are put away; and\nthen defilement is escaped by this first means; thus then by equal steps\nthe excellent law results from life restored by food and drink.”</p>\n<p>Having carefully considered this principle, bathing in the Nairañgana\nriver, he desired afterwards to leave the water, but owing to extreme\nexhaustion was unable to rise; then a heavenly spirit holding out a\nbranch, taking this in his hand he raised himself and came forth. At\nthis time on the opposite side of the grove there was a certain chief\nherdsman, whose eldest daughter was called Nandâ. One of the Suddhavâsa\nDevas addressing her said, “Bodhisattva dwells in the grove, go you\nthen, and present to him a religious offering.”</p>\n<p>Nandâ Balada (or Balaga or Baladhya) with joy came to the spot, above\nher hands (i.e. on her wrists) white chalcedony bracelets, her clothing\nof a gray color; the gray and the white together contrasted in the\nlight, as the colors of the rounded river bubble; with simple heart and\nquickened step she came, and, bowing down at Bodhisattva’s feet, she\nreverently offered him perfumed rice milk, begging him of his\ncondescension to accept it. Bodhisattva taking it, partook of it at\nonce, whilst she received, even then, the fruits of her religious act.\nHaving eaten it, all his members refreshed, he became capable of\nreceiving Bodhi; his body and limbs glistening with renewed strength,\nand his energies swelling higher still, as the hundred streams swell the\nsea, or the first quartered moon daily increases in brightness. The five\nBhikshus having witnessed this, perturbed, were filled with suspicious\nreflection; they supposed that his religious zeal was flagging, and that\nhe was leaving and looking for a better abode, as though he had obtained\ndeliverance, the five elements entirely removed.</p>\n<p>Bodhisattva wandered on alone, directing his course to that “fortunate”\ntree,<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> beneath whose shade he might accomplish his search after\ncomplete enlightenment. Over the ground wide and level, producing soft\nand pliant grass, easily he advanced with lion step, pace by pace,\nwhilst the earth shook withal; and as it shook, Kâla nâga aroused, was\nfilled with joy, as his eyes were opened to the light. Forthwith he\nexclaimed: “When formerly I saw the Buddhas of old, there was the sign\nof an earthquake as now; the virtues of a Muni are so great in majesty,\nthat the great earth cannot endure them; as step by step his foot treads\nupon the ground, so is there heard the sound of the rumbling\nearth-shaking; a brilliant light now illumes the world, as the shining\nof the rising sun; five hundred bluish-tinted birds I see, wheeling\nround to the right, flying through space; a gentle, soft, and cooling\nbreeze blows around in an agreeable way; all these auspicious signs are\nthe same as those of former Buddhas; wherefore I know that this\nBodhisattva will certainly arrive at perfect wisdom. And now, behold!\nfrom yonder man, a grass cutter, he obtains some pure and pliant grass,\nwhich spreading out beneath the tree, with upright body, there he takes\nhis seat; his feet placed under him, not carelessly arranged, moving to\nand fro, but like the firmly fixed and compact body of a Nâga; nor shall\nhe rise again from off his seat till he has completed his undertaking.”\nAnd so he (the Nâga) uttered these words by way of confirmation. The\nheavenly Nâgas, filled with joy, caused a cool refreshing breeze to\nrise; the trees and grass were yet unmoved by it, and all the beasts,\nquiet and silent, looked on in wonderment.</p>\n<p>These are the signs that Bodhisattva will certainly attain\nenlightenment.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iii/defeats-mara/\">Defeats Mara</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>The dhyânas are the conditions of ecstasy, enjoyed by the inhabitants of the Brahmaloka heavens.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>The “fortunate tree,” the tree “of good omen,” the Bodhi tree.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The child of the glorious sun of the Ikshvâku race, going to that quiet\npeaceful grove, reverently stood before the Muni, the great Rishi Ârâda\nRâma; the dark-clad followers of the Kalam (Sanghârâma) seeing afar-off\nBodhisattva approaching, with loud voice raised a joyful chant, and with\nsuppressed breath muttered “Welcome,” as with clasped hands they\nreverenced him.

This, you say, is true release; you say ‘letting go\nthe ground on which the idea of soul rests,’ that this frees us from\n‘limited existence,’ and that the mass of people have not yet removed\nthe idea of soul, and are therefore still in bondage. But what is this\nletting go gunas (cords fettering the soul); if one is fettered by these\ngunas, how can there be release? For gunî (the object) and guna (the\nquality) in idea are different, but in substance one; if you say that\nyou can remove the properties of a thing and leave the thing by arguing\nit to the end, this is not so. If you remove heat from fire, then there\nis no such thing as fire, or if you remove surface from body, what body\ncan remain? Thus guna is as it were surface, remove this and there can\nbe no gunî. So that this deliverance, spoken of before, must leave a\nbody yet in bonds. Again, you say that by clear knowledge you get rid of\nbody; there is then such a thing as knowledge or the contrary; if you\naffirm the existence of clear knowledge, then there should be someone\nwho possesses it (i.e. possesses this knowledge); if there be a\npossesor, how can there be deliverance from this personal ‘I’? If you\nsay there is no ‘knower,’ then who is it that is spoken of as ‘knowing’?\nIf there is knowledge and no person, then the subject of knowledge may\nbe a stone or a log; moreover, to have clear knowledge of these minute\ncauses of contamination and reject them thoroughly, these being so\nrejected, there must be an end, then, of the ‘doer.’ What Ârâda has\ndeclared cannot satisfy my heart. This clear knowledge is not universal\nwisdom, I must go on and seek a better explanation.”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Going on then to the place of Udra Rishi, he also expatiated on this\nquestion of “I.” But although he refined the matter to the utmost,\nlaying down a term of “thought” and “no thought” taking the position of\nremoving “thought” and “no thought,” yet even so he came not out of the\nmire; for supposing creatures attained that state, still (he said) there\nis a possibility of returning to the coil, whilst Bodhisattva sought a\nmethod of getting out of it.
