Tathâgata, by wise expedient, caused them one by one\nto embrace the law. And so from first to last the five Bhikshus obtained\nreason and subdued their senses, like the five stars which shine in\nheaven, waiting upon the brightening moon. At this time in the town of\nKu-i there was a noble’s son called Yasas; lost in night-sleep suddenly\nhe woke, and when he saw his attendants all, men and women, with\nill-clad bodies, sleeping, his heart was filled with loathing;\nreflecting on the root of sorrow, he thought how madly foolish men were\nimmersed in it. Clothing himself, and putting on his jewels, he left his\nhome and wandered forth; then on the way he stood and cried aloud,\n“Alas! alas! what endless chain of sorrows.” Tathâgata, by night, was\nwalking forth, and hearing sounds like these, “Alas! what sorrow,”\nforthwith replied, “You are welcome! here, on the other hand, there is a\nplace of rest—the most excellent, refreshing, Nirvâna, quiet and\nunmoved, free from sorrow.” Yasas hearing Buddha’s exhortation, there\nrose much joy within his heart. And in the place of the disgust he felt,\nthe cooling streams of holy wisdom found their way, as when one enters\nfirst a cold pellucid lake. Advancing then, he came where Buddha\nwas—his person decked with common ornaments, his mind already freed\nfrom all defects; by power of the good root obtained in other births, he\nquickly reached the fruit of an Arhat. The secret light of pure wisdom’s\nvirtue enabled him to understand, on listening to the law; just as a\npure silken fabric with ease is dyed a different color. Thus having\nattained to self-illumination, and done that which was to be done, he\nwas converted; then looking at his person richly ornamented, his heart\nwas filled with shame. Tathâgata knowing his inward thoughts, in gâthas\nspoke the following words: “Though ornamented with jewels, the heart may\nyet have conquered sense; looking with equal mind on all that lives, in\nsuch a case the outward form does not affect religion; the body, too,\nmay wear the ascetic’s garb, the heart, meanwhile, be immersed in\nworldly thoughts; dwelling in lonely woods, yet covetous of worldly\nshow, such men are after all mere worldlings; the body may have a\nworldly guise, the heart mount high to things celestial. The layman and\nthe hermit are the same, when only both have banished thought of ‘self,’\nbut if the heart be twined with carnal bonds, what use the marks of\nbodily attention? He who wears martial decorations, does so because by\nvalor he has triumphed o’er an enemy—so he who wears the hermit’s\ncolored robe, does so for having vanquished sorrow as his foe.” Then he\nbade him come, and be a member of his church; and at the bidding, lo!\nhis garments changed! and he stood wholly attired in hermit’s dress,\ncomplete; in heart and outward look, a Sramana. Now Yasas had in former\ndays some light companions, in number fifty and four; when these beheld\ntheir friend a hermit, they, too, one by one, attained true wisdom. By\nvirtue of deeds done in former births, these deeds now bore their\nperfect fruit. Just as when burning ashes are sprinkled by water, the\nwater being dried, the flame bursts forth. So now, with those above, the\ndisciples were altogether sixty, all Arhats; entirely obedient and\ninstructed in the law of perfect discipleship. So perfected he taught\nthem further:—“Now ye have passed the stream and reached ‘the other\nshore,’ across the sea of birth and death; what should be done, ye now\nhave done! and ye may now receive the charity of others. Go then through\nevery country, convert those not yet converted; throughout the world\nthat lies burnt up with sorrow, teach everywhere; instruct those lacking\nright instruction. Go, therefore! each one travelling by himself; filled\nwith compassion, go! rescue and receive. I too will go alone, back to\nyonder Kia-ke mountain; where there are great Rishis, royal Rishis,\nBrahman Rishis too, these all dwell there, influencing men according to\ntheir schools. The Rishi Kâsyapa, enduring pain, reverenced by all the\ncountry, making converts too of many, him will I visit and convert.”\nThen the sixty Bhikshus respectfully receiving orders to preach, each\naccording to his fore-determined purpose, following his inclination,\nwent through every land. The honored of the world went on alone, till he\narrived at the Kia-ke mountain, then entering a retired religious dell,\nhe came to where the Rishi Kâsyapa was. Now this one had a “fire grot”\nwhere he offered sacrifice, where an evil Nâga dwelt, who wandered here\nand there in search of rest, through mountains and wild places of the\nearth. The honored of the world, wishing to instruct this hermit and\nconvert him, asked him, on coming, for a place to lodge that night.\nKâsyapa, replying, spake to Buddha thus:—“I have no resting-place to\noffer for the night, only this fire grot where I sacrifice; this is a\ncool and fit place for the purpose, but an evil dragon dwells there, who\nis accustomed, as he can, to poison men.” Buddha replied, “Permit me\nonly, and for the night I’ll take my dwelling there.” Kâsyapa made many\ndifficulties, but the world-honored one still asked the favor. Then\nKâsyapa addressed Buddha, “My mind desires no controversy, only I have\nmy fears and apprehensions, but follow you your own good pleasure.”\nBuddha forthwith stepped within the fiery grot, and took his seat with\ndignity and deep reflection; and now the evil Nâga seeing Buddha,\nbelched forth in rage his fiery poison, and filled the place with\nburning vapor. But this could not affect the form of Buddha. Throughout\nthe abode the fire consumed itself, the honored of the world still sat\ncomposed: Even as Brahma, in the midst of the kalpa-fire that burns and\nreaches to the Brahma heavens, still sits unmoved, without a thought of\nfear or apprehension, so Buddha sat; the evil Nâga seeing him, his face\nglowing with peace, and still unchanged, ceased his poisonous blast, his\nheart appeased; he bent his head and worshipped. Kâsyapa in the night\nseeing the fire-glow, sighed:—“Ah! alas! what misery! this most\ndistinguished man is also burnt up by the fiery Nâga.” Then Kâsyapa and\nhis followers at morning light came one and all to look. Now Buddha\nhaving subdued the evil Nâga, had straightway placed him in his pâtra,\nbeholding which, and seeing the power of Buddha, Kâsyapa conceived\nwithin him deep and secret thoughts:—“This Gotama,” he thought, “is\ndeeply versed in religion, but still he said, ‘I am a master of\nreligion.‘” Then Buddha, as occasion offered, displayed all kinds of\nspiritual changes, influencing Kâsyapa’s heart-thoughts, changing and\nsubduing them, making his mind pliant and yielding, until at length\nprepared to be a vessel of the true law, he confessed that his poor\nwisdom could not compare with the complete wisdom of the world-honored\none. And so, convinced at last, humbly submitting, he accepted right\ninstruction. Thus U-pi-lo Uravilva Kâsyapa, and five hundred of his\nfollowers following their master, virtuously submissive, in turn\nreceived the teaching of the law. Kâsyapa and all his followers were\nthus entirely converted. The Rishi then, taking his goods and all his\nsacrificial vessels, threw them together in the river, which floated\ndown upon the surface of the current. Nadi and Gada, brothers, who dwelt\ndown the stream, seeing these articles of clothing and the rest floating\nalong the stream disorderly, said, “Some great change has happened,” and\ndeeply pained, were restlessly concerned. The two, each with five\nhundred followers, going up the stream to seek their brother. Seeing him\nnow dressed as a hermit, and all his followers with him, having got\nknowledge of the miraculous law—strange thoughts engaged their\nminds—“our brother having submitted thus, we too should also follow\nhim.” Thus the three brothers, with all their band of followers, were\nbrought to hear the lord’s discourse on the comparison of a fire\nsacrifice: and in the discourse he taught, “How the dark smoke of\nignorance arises, whilst confused thoughts, like wood drilled into wood,\ncreate the fire. Lust, anger, delusion, these are as fire produced, and\nthese inflame and burn all living things. Thus the fire of grief and\nsorrow, once enkindled, ceases not to burn, ever giving rise to birth\nand death; but whilst this fire of sorrow ceases not, yet are there two\nkinds of fire, one that burns but has no fuel left. So when the heart of\nman has once conceived distaste for sin, this distaste removing covetous\ndesire, covetous desire extinguished, there is rescue; if once this\nrescue has been found, then with it is born sight and knowledge, by\nwhich distinguishing the streams of birth and death, and practising pure\nconduct, all is done that should be done, and hereafter shall be no more\nlife.” Thus the thousand Bhikshus hearing the world-honored preach, all\ndefects forever done away, their minds found perfect and complete\ndeliverance. Then Buddha for the Kâsyapas’ sakes, and for the benefit of\nthe thousand Bhikshus, having preached, and done all that should be\ndone, himself with purity and wisdom and all the concourse of high\nqualities excellently adorned, he gave them, as in charity, rules for\ncleansing sense. The great Rishi, listening to reason, lost all regard\nfor bodily austerities, and, as a man without a guide, was emptied of\nhimself, and learned discipleship. And now the honored one and all his\nfollowers go forward to the royal city (Râgagriha), remembering, as he\ndid, the Magadha king, and what he heretofore had promised. The honored\none when he arrived, remained within the “staff grove”; Bimbisâra Râga\nhearing thereof, with all his company of courtiers, lords and ladies all\nsurrounding him, came to where the master was. Then at a distance seeing\nBuddha seated, with humbled heart and subdued presence, putting off his\ncommon ornaments, descending from his chariot, forward he stepped; even\nas Sakra, king of gods, going to where Brahmadeva-râga dwells. Bowing\ndown at Buddha’s feet, he asked him, with respect, about his health of\nbody; Buddha in his turn, having made inquiries, begged him to be seated\non one side. Then the king’s mind reflected silently:—“This Sâkya must\nhave great controlling power, to subject to his will these Kâsyapas who\nnow are round him as disciples.” Buddha, knowing all thoughts, spoke\nthus to Kâsyapa, questioning him:—“What profit have you found in giving\nup your fire-adoring law?” Kâsyapa hearing Buddha’s words, rising with\ndignity before the great assembly, bowed lowly down, and then with\nclasped hands and a loud voice addressing Buddha, said:—“The profit I\nreceived, adoring the fire spirit, was this—continuance in the wheel of\nlife, birth and death, with all their sorrows growing—this service I\nhave therefore cast away. Diligently I persevered in fire-worship,\nseeking to put an end to the five desires, in return I found desires\nendlessly increasing: therefore have I cast off this service.\nSacrificing thus to fire with many Mantras, I did but miss escape from\nbirth; receiving birth, with it came all its sorrows, therefore I cast\nit off and sought for rest. I was versed, indeed, in self-affliction, my\nmode of worship largely adopted, and counted of all most excellent, and\nyet I was opposed to highest wisdom. Therefore have I discarded it, and\ngone in quest of the supreme Nirvâna. Removing from me birth, old age,\ndisease, and death, I sought a place of undying rest and calm. And as I\ngained the knowledge of this truth, then I cast off the law of\nworshipping the fire.”</p>\n<p>The honored-of-the-world, hearing Kâsyapa declaring his experience of\ntruth, wishing to move the world throughout to conceive a heart of\npurity and faith, addressing Kâsyapa further, said: “Welcome! great\nmaster, welcome! Rightly have you distinguished law from law, and well\nobtained the highest wisdom; now before this great assembly, pray you!\nexhibit your excellent endowments; as any rich and wealthy noble opens\nfor view his costly treasures, causing the poor and sorrow-laden\nmultitude to increase their forgetfulness awhile; and honor well your\nlord’s instruction.” Forthwith in presence of the assembly, gathering up\nhis body and entering Samâdhi, calmly he ascended into space, and there\ndisplayed himself, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, emitting fiery\nvapor from his body, on his right and left side water and fire, not\nburning and not moistening him. Then clouds and rain proceeded from him,\nthunder with lightning shook the heaven and earth; thus he drew the\nworld to look in adoration, with eyes undazzled as they gazed; with\ndifferent mouths, but all in language one, they magnified and praised\nthis wondrous spectacle, then afterwards drawn by spiritual force, they\ncame and worshipped at the master’s feet, exclaiming:—“Buddha is our\ngreat teacher! we are the honored one’s disciples.” Thus having\nmagnified his work and finished all he purposed doing, drawing the world\nas universal witness, the assembly was convinced that he, the\nworld-honored, was truly the “Omniscient!” Buddha, perceiving that the\nwhole assembly was ready as a vessel to receive the law, spoke thus to\nBimbisâra Râga: “Listen now and understand: The mind, the thoughts, and\nall the senses are subject to the law of life and death. This fault of\nbirth and death, once understood, then there is clear and plain\nperception. Obtaining this clear perception, then there is born\nknowledge of self; knowing oneself and with this knowledge laws of birth\nand death, then there is no grasping and no sense-perception. Knowing\noneself, and understanding how the senses act, then there is no room for\n‘I’ (soul) or ground for framing it; then all the accumulated mass of\nsorrow, sorrows born from life and death, being recognized as attributes\nof body, and as this body is not ‘I,’ nor offers ground for ‘I,’ then\ncomes the great superlative, the source of peace unending. This thought\nof ‘self’ gives rise to all these sorrows, binding as with cords the\nworld, but having found there is no ‘I’ that can be bound, then all\nthese bonds are severed. There are no bonds indeed—they disappear—and\nseeing this there is deliverance. The world holds to this thought of\n‘I,’ and so, from this, comes false apprehension. Of those who maintain\nthe truth of it, some say the ‘I’ endures, some say it perishes; taking\nthe two extremes of birth and death, their error is most grievous! For\nif they say the ‘I’ is perishable, the fruit they strive for, too, will\nperish; and at some time there will be no hereafter: this is indeed a\nmeritless deliverance. But if they say the ‘I’ is not to perish, then in\nthe midst of all this life and death there is but one identity as space,\nwhich is not born and does not die. If this is what they call the ‘I,’\nthen are all things living, one—for all have this unchanging self—not\nperfected by any deeds, but self-perfect. If so, if such a self it is\nthat acts, let there be no self-mortifying conduct, the self is lord and\nmaster; what need to do that which is done? For if this ‘I’ is lasting\nand imperishable, then reason would teach it never can be changed. But\nnow we see the marks of joy and sorrow, what room for constancy then is\nhere? Knowing that birth brings this deliverance then I put away all\nthought of sin’s defilement; the whole world, everything, endures! what\nthen becomes of this idea of rescue? We cannot even talk of putting self\naway, truth is the same as falsehood; it is not ‘I’ that do a thing, and\nwho, forsooth, is he that talks of ‘I’? But if it is not ‘I’ that do the\nthing, then there is no ‘I’ that does it, and in the absence of these\nboth, there is no ‘I’ at all, in very truth. No doer and no knower, no\nlord, yet notwithstanding this, there ever lasts this birth and death,\nlike morn and night ever recurring. But now attend to me and listen: The\nsenses six and their six objects united cause the six kinds of\nknowledge, these three united bring forth contact, then the intervolved\neffects of recollection follow. Then like the burning glass and tinder\nthrough the sun’s power cause fire to appear, so through the knowledge\nborn of sense and object, the lord of knowledge (self) is born. The\nshoot springs from the seed, the seed is not the shoot, not one and yet\nnot different: such is the birth of all that lives.” The honored of the\nworld preaching the truth, the equal and impartial paramârtha, thus\naddressed the king with all his followers. Then King Bimbisâra filled\nwith joy, removing from himself defilement, gained religious sight, a\nhundred thousand spirits also, hearing the words of the immortal law,\nshook off and lost the stain of sin.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/the-great-disciple-becomes-a-hermit/\">The Great Disciple Becomes a Hermit</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And now those five men, Asvagit Vâshpa, and the others, having heard\nthat he (Kaundinya) “knew” the law, with humble mien and self-subdued,\ntheir hands joined, offered their homage, and looked with reverence in\nthe teacher’s face.

Knowing\noneself, and understanding how the senses act, then there is no room for\n‘I’ (soul) or ground for framing it; then all the accumulated mass of\nsorrow, sorrows born from life and death, being recognized as attributes\nof body, and as this body is not ‘I,’ nor offers ground for ‘I,’ then\ncomes the great superlative, the source of peace unending. This thought\nof ‘self’ gives rise to all these sorrows, binding as with cords the\nworld, but having found there is no ‘I’ that can be bound, then all\nthese bonds are severed. There are no bonds indeed—they disappear—and\nseeing this there is deliverance. The world holds to this thought of\n‘I,’ and so, from this, comes false apprehension. Of those who maintain\nthe truth of it, some say the ‘I’ endures, some say it perishes; taking\nthe two extremes of birth and death, their error is most grievous! For\nif they say the ‘I’ is perishable, the fruit they strive for, too, will\nperish; and at some time there will be no hereafter: this is indeed a\nmeritless deliverance. But if they say the ‘I’ is not to perish, then in\nthe midst of all this life and death there is but one identity as space,\nwhich is not born and does not die. If this is what they call the ‘I,’\nthen are all things living, one—for all have this unchanging self—not\nperfected by any deeds, but self-perfect. If so, if such a self it is\nthat acts, let there be no self-mortifying conduct, the self is lord and\nmaster; what need to do that which is done? For if this ‘I’ is lasting\nand imperishable, then reason would teach it never can be changed. But\nnow we see the marks of joy and sorrow, what room for constancy then is\nhere? Knowing that birth brings this deliverance then I put away all\nthought of sin’s defilement; the whole world, everything, endures! what\nthen becomes of this idea of rescue? We cannot even talk of putting self\naway, truth is the same as falsehood; it is not ‘I’ that do a thing, and\nwho, forsooth, is he that talks of ‘I’? But if it is not ‘I’ that do the\nthing, then there is no ‘I’ that does it, and in the absence of these\nboth, there is no ‘I’ at all, in very truth. No doer and no knower, no\nlord, yet notwithstanding this, there ever lasts this birth and death,\nlike morn and night ever recurring. But now attend to me and listen: The\nsenses six and their six objects united cause the six kinds of\nknowledge, these three united bring forth contact, then the intervolved\neffects of recollection follow. Then like the burning glass and tinder\nthrough the sun’s power cause fire to appear, so through the knowledge\nborn of sense and object, the lord of knowledge (self) is born. The\nshoot springs from the seed, the seed is not the shoot, not one and yet\nnot different: such is the birth of all that lives.” The honored of the\nworld preaching the truth, the equal and impartial paramârtha, thus\naddressed the king with all his followers. Then King Bimbisâra filled\nwith joy, removing from himself defilement, gained religious sight, a\nhundred thousand spirits also, hearing the words of the immortal law,\nshook off and lost the stain of sin."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"style":"text-align:center"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/the-great-disciple-becomes-a-hermit/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Great Disciple Becomes a Hermit"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"excerpt":"And now those five men, Asvagit Vâshpa, and the others, having heard\nthat he (Kaundinya) “knew” the law, with humble mien and self-subdued…","timeToRead":11,"frontmatter":{"type":"text","title":"Life of Buddha","userDate":null,"date":null,"tags":null,"excerpt":"Bimbisâra Râga Becomes a Disciple","parentPath":null,"picture":null,"author":["Aśvaghoṣa"]}},"relatedPosts":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/bimbisara-raga-becomes-a-disciple/","prev":{"excerpt":"At this time there was a great householder whose name was “Friend of the\nOrphaned and Destitute”; he was very rich and widely charitable in…","timeToRead":12,"frontmatter":{"title":"Life of Buddha","type":"text","hidden":true,"tags":null,"date":null,"draft":false,"excerpt":"Conversion of the \"Supporter of the Orphans and Destitute\"","author":["Aśvaghoṣa"]},"fields":{"layout":"post","slug":"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/conversion-of-the-supporter-of-the-orphans-and-destitute/"}},"next":{"excerpt":"At this time there was a Brahmakârin whose name was Su-po-to-lo; he was\nwell-known for his virtuous qualities, leading a pure life according…","timeToRead":15,"frontmatter":{"title":"Life of Buddha","type":"text","hidden":true,"tags":null,"date":null,"draft":false,"excerpt":"Mahâparinirvâna","author":["Aśvaghoṣa"]},"fields":{"layout":"post","slug":"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/mahaparinirvana/"}},"primaryTag":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614332127"]}
