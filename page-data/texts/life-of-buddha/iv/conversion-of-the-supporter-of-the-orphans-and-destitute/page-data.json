Now this man, coming far away from the\nnorth, even from the country of Kosala, stopped at the house of a friend\nwhose name was Sheu-lo. Hearing that Buddha was in the world and\ndwelling in the bamboo grove near at hand, understanding moreover his\nrenown and illustrious qualities, he set out that very night for the\ngrove. Tathâgata, well aware of his character, and that he was prepared\nto bring forth purity and faith, according to the case, called him by\nhis true name, and for his sake addressed him in words of\nreligion:—“Having rejoiced in the true law, and being humbly desirous\nfor a pure and believing heart, thou hast overcome desire for sleep, and\nart here to pay me reverence. Now then will I for your sake discharge\nfully the duties of a first meeting. In your former births the root of\nvirtue planted firm in pure and rare expectancy, hearing now the name of\nBuddha, you rejoiced because you are a vessel fit for righteousness,\nhumble in mind, but large in gracious deeds, abundant in your charity to\nthe poor and helpless. The name you possess widespread and famous, the\njust reward of former merit, the deeds you now perform are done of\ncharity: done with the fullest purpose and of single heart. Now,\ntherefore, take from me the charity of perfect rest, and for this end\naccept my rules of purity. My rules are full of grace, able to rescue\nfrom destruction, and cause a man to ascend to heaven and share in all\nits pleasures. But yet to seek for these is a great evil, for lustful\nlonging in its increase brings much sorrow. Practise then the art of\n‘giving up’ all search, for ‘giving up’ desire is the joy of perfect\nrest. Know then! that age, disease, and death, these are the great\nsorrows of the world. Rightly considering the world, we put away birth\nand old age, disease and death; but now because we see that men at large\ninherit sorrow caused by age, disease, and death, we gather that when\nborn in heaven, the case is also thus; for there is no continuance there\nfor any, and where there is no continuance there is sorrow, and having\nsorrow there is no ‘true self.’ And if the state of ‘no continuance’ and\nof sorrow is opposed to ‘self,’ what room is there for such idea or\nground for self? Know then! that ‘sorrow’ is this very sorrow and its\nrepetition is ‘accumulation’; destroy this sorrow and there is joy, the\nway is in the calm and quiet place. The restless busy nature of the\nworld, this I declare is at the root of pain. Stop then the end by\nchoking up the source. Desire not either life or its opposite; the\nraging fire of birth, old age, and death burns up the world on every\nside. Seeing the constant toil of birth and death we ought to strive to\nattain a passive state: the final goal of Sammata, the place of\nimmortality and rest. All is empty! neither ‘self,’ nor place for\n‘self,’ but all the world is like a phantasy; this is the way to regard\nourselves, as but a heap of composite qualities.”</p>\n<p>The nobleman, hearing the spoken law, forthwith attained the first\ndegree of holiness: he emptied as it were, the sea of birth and death,\none drop alone remaining. By practising, apart from men, the banishment\nof all desire, he soon attained the one impersonal condition, not as\ncommon folk do now-a-day who speculate upon the mode of true\ndeliverance; for he who does not banish sorrow-causing samskâras does\nbut involve himself in every kind of question; and though he reaches to\nthe highest form of being, yet grasps not the one and only truth.\nErroneous thoughts as to the joy of heaven are still entwined by the\nfast cords of lust. The nobleman attending to the spoken law the cloud\nof darkness opened before the shining splendor. Thus he attained true\nsight, erroneous views forever dissipated; even as the furious winds of\nautumn sway to and fro and scatter all the heaped-up clouds. He argued\nnot that Isvara was cause, nor did he advocate some cause heretical, nor\nyet again did he affirm there was no cause for the beginning of the\nworld. “If the world was made by Isvara deva, there should be neither\nyoung nor old, first nor after, nor the five ways of birth; and when\nonce born there should be no destruction. Nor should there be such thing\nas sorrow or calamity, nor doing wrong nor doing right; for all, both\npure and impure deeds, these must come from Isvara deva. Again, if\nIsvara deva made the world there should be never doubt about the fact,\neven as a son born of his father ever confesses him and pays him\nreverence. Men when pressed by sore calamity ought not to rebel against\nhim, but rather reverence him completely, as the self-existent. Nor\nought they to adore more gods than one. Again, if Isvara be the maker he\nshould not be called the self-existent, because in that he is the maker\nnow he always should have been the maker; but if ever making, then ever\nself-remembering, and therefore not the self-existent one—and if he\nmade without a purpose then is he like the sucking child; but if he made\nhaving an ever prompting purpose, then is he not, with such a purpose,\nself-existent? Sorrow and joy spring up in all that lives, these at\nleast are not the works of Isvara; for if he causes grief and joy, he\nmust himself have love and hate; but if he loves unduly, or has hatred,\nhe cannot properly be named the self-existent. Again, if Isvara be the\nmaker, all living things should silently submit, patient beneath the\nmaker’s power, and then what use to practise virtue? Twere equal, then,\nthe doing right or wrong: there should be no reward of works; the works\nthemselves being his making, then all things are the same with him, the\nmaker, but if all things are one with him, then our deeds, and we who do\nthem, are also self-existent. But if Isvara be uncreated, then all\nthings, being one with him, are uncreated. But if you say there is\nanother cause beside him as creator, then Isvara is not the ‘end of\nall’; Isvara, who ought to be inexhaustible, is not so, and therefore\nall that lives may after all be uncreated—without a maker. Thus, you\nsee, the thought of Isvara is overthrown in this discussion; and all\nsuch contradictory assertions should be exposed; if not, the blame is\nours. Again, if it be said self-nature is the maker, this is as faulty\nas the first assertion; nor has either of the Hetuvidyâ sâstras asserted\nsuch a thing as this, till now. That which depends on nothing cannot as\na cause make that which is; but all things round us come from a cause,\nas the plant comes from the seed; we cannot therefore say that all\nthings are produced by self-nature. Again, all things which exist spring\nnot from one nature as a cause; and yet you say self-nature is but one:\nit cannot then be cause of all. If you say that that self-nature\npervades and fills all places, if it pervades and fills all things, then\ncertainly it cannot make them too; for there would be nothing, then, to\nmake, and therefore this cannot be the cause. If, again, it fills all\nplaces and yet makes all things that exist, then it should throughout\n‘all time’ have made forever that which is. But if you say it made\nthings thus, then there is nothing to be made ‘in time’; know then, for\ncertain, self-nature cannot be the cause of all. Again, they say that\nthat self-nature excludes all modifications, therefore all things made\nby it ought likewise to be free from modifications. But we see, in fact,\nthat all things in the world are fettered throughout by modifications;\ntherefore, again, we say that self-nature cannot be the cause of all.\nIf, again, you say that that self-nature is different from such\nqualities, we answer, since self-nature must have ever caused, it cannot\ndiffer in its nature from itself; but if the world be different from\nthese qualities, then self-nature cannot be the cause. Again, if\nself-nature be unchangeable, so things should also be without decay; if\nwe regard self-nature as the cause, then cause and consequence of reason\nshould be one; but because we see decay in all things, we know that they\nat least are caused. Again, if self-nature be the cause, why should we\nseek to find ‘escape’? for we ourselves possess this nature; patient\nthen should we endure both birth and death. For let us take the case\nthat one may find ‘escape,’ self-nature still will reconstruct the evil\nof birth. If self-nature in itself be blind, yet ‘tis the maker of the\nworld that sees. On this account, again, it cannot be the maker,\nbecause, in this case, cause and effect would differ in their character,\nbut in all the world around us, cause and effect go hand in hand. Again,\nif self-nature have no aim, it cannot cause that which has such purpose.\nWe know on seeing smoke there must be fire, and cause and result are\never classed together thus. We are forbidden, then, to say an unthinking\ncause can make a thing that has intelligence. The gold of which the cup\nis made is gold throughout from first to last, self-nature, then, that\nmakes these things, from first to last must permeate all it makes. Once\nmore, if ‘time’ is maker of the world, ‘twere needless then to seek\n‘escape,’ for ‘time’ is constant and unchangeable: let us in patience\nbear the ‘intervals’ of time. The world in its successions has no\nlimits, the ‘intervals’ of time are boundless also. Those then who\npractise a religious life need not rely on ‘methods’ or ‘expedients.’\nThe To-lo-piu Kiu-na, the one strange Sâstra in the world, although it\nhas so many theories, yet still, be it known, it is opposed to any\nsingle cause. But if, again, you say that ‘self’ is maker, then surely\nself should make things pleasingly; but now things are not pleasing for\noneself, how then is it said that self is maker? But if he did not wish\nto make things so, then he who wishes for things pleasing, is opposed to\nself, the maker. Sorrow and joy are not self-existing, how can these be\nmade by self? But if we allow that self was maker, there should not be,\nat least, an evil karman; but yet our deeds produce results both good\nand evil; know then that ‘self’ cannot be maker. But perhaps you say\n‘self’ is the maker according to occasion, and then the occasion ought\nto be for good alone. But as good and evil both result from ‘cause,’ it\ncannot be that ‘self’ has made it so. But if you adopt the\nargument—there is no maker—then it is useless practising expedients;\nall things are fixed and certain of themselves: what good to try to make\nthem otherwise? Deeds of every kind, done in the world, do,\nnotwithstanding, bring forth every kind of fruit; therefore we argue all\nthings that exist are not without some cause or other. There is both\n‘mind’ and ‘want of mind’—all things come from fixed causation; the\nworld and all therein is not the result of ‘nothing’ as a cause.” The\nnobleman, his heart receiving light, perceived throughout the most\nexcellent system of truth. Simple, and of wisdom born; thus firmly\nsettled in the true doctrine he lowly bent in worship at the feet of\nBuddha and with closed hands made his request:—</p>\n<p>“I dwell indeed at Srâvasti, a land rich in produce, and enjoying peace;\nPrasenagit is the great king thereof, the offspring of the ‘lion’\nfamily; his high renown and fame spread everywhere, reverenced by all\nboth far and near. Now am I wishful there to found a Vihâra, I pray you\nof your tenderness accept it from me. I know the heart of Buddha has no\npreferences, nor does he seek a resting-place from labor, but on behalf\nof all that lives refuse not my request.”</p>\n<p>Buddha, knowing the householder’s heart, that his great charity was now\nthe moving cause—untainted and unselfish charity, nobly considerate of\nthe heart of all that lives—he said:</p>\n<p>“Now you have seen the true doctrine, your guileless heart loves to\nexercise its charity: for wealth and money are inconstant treasures,\n‘twere better quickly to bestow such things on others. For when a\ntreasury has been burnt, whatever precious things may have escaped the\nfire, the wise man, knowing their inconstancy, gives freely, doing acts\nof kindness with his saved possessions. But the niggard guards them\ncarefully, fearing to lose them, worn by anxiety, but never fearing\n‘inconstancy,’ and that accumulated sorrow, when he loses all! There is\na proper time and a proper mode in charity; just as the vigorous warrior\ngoes to battle, so is the man ‘able to give’—he also is an able\nwarrior; a champion strong and wise in action. The charitable man is\nloved by all, well-known and far-renowned! his friendship prized by the\ngentle and the good, in death his heart at rest and full of joy! He\nsuffers no repentance, no tormenting fear, nor is he born a wretched\nghost or demon! this is the opening flower of his reward, the fruit that\nfollows—hard to conjecture! In all the six conditions born there is no\nsweet companion like pure charity; if born a Deva or a man, then charity\nbrings worship and renown on every hand; if born among the lower\ncreatures, the result of charity will follow in contentment got; wisdom\nleads the way to fixed composure without dependence and without number,\nand if we even reach the immortal path, still by continuous acts of\ncharity we fulfil ourselves in consequence of kindly charity done\nelsewhere. Training ourselves in the eightfold path of recollection, in\nevery thought the heart is filled with joy; firm fixed in holy\ncontemplation, by meditation still we add to wisdom, able to see aright\nthe cause of birth and death; having beheld aright the cause of these,\nthen follows in due order perfect deliverance. The charitable man\ndiscarding earthly wealth, nobly excludes the power of covetous desire;\nloving and compassionate now, he gives with reverence and banishes all\nhatred, envy, anger. So plainly may we see the fruit of charity, putting\naway all covetous and unbelieving ways, the bands of sorrow all\ndestroyed: this is the fruit of kindly charity. Know then! the\ncharitable man has found the cause of final rescue; even as the man who\nplants the sapling thereby secures the shade, the flowers, the fruit of\nthe tree full grown; the result of charity is even so, its reward is joy\nand the great Nirvâna. The charity which un-stores wealth leads to\nreturns of well-stored fruit. Giving away our food we get more strength,\ngiving away our clothes we get more beauty, founding religious\nrest-places we reap the perfect fruit of the best charity. There is a\nway of giving, seeking pleasure by it; there is a way of giving,\ncoveting to get more; some also give away to get a name for charity,\nothers to get the happiness of heaven, others to avoid the pain of being\npoor hereafter, but yours, O friend! is a charity without such thoughts:\nthe highest and the best degree of charity, without self-interest or\nthought of getting more. What your heart inclines you now to do, let it\nbe quickly done and well completed! The uncertain and the lustful heart\ngoes wandering here and there, but the pure eyes of virtue opening, the\nheart comes back and rests!” The nobleman accepting Buddha’s teaching,\nhis kindly heart receiving yet more light.</p>\n<p>He invited Upatishya, his excellent friend, to accompany him on his\nreturn to Kosala; and then going round to select a pleasant site, he saw\nthe garden of the heir-apparent, Geta, the groves and limpid streams\nmost pure. Proceeding where the prince was dwelling, he asked for leave\nto buy the ground; the prince, because he valued it so much, at first\nwas not inclined to sell, but said at last:—“If you can cover it with\ngold then, but not else, you may possess it.”</p>\n<p>The nobleman, his heart rejoicing, forthwith began to spread his gold.\nThen Geta said: “I will not give, why then spread you your gold?” The\nnobleman replied, “Not give; why then said you, ‘Fill it with yellow\ngold’?” And thus they differed and contended both, till they resorted to\nthe magistrate.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the people whispered much about his unwonted charity, and Geta\ntoo, knowing the man’s sincerity, asked more about the matter: what his\nreasons were. On his reply, “I wish to found a Vihâra, and offer it to\nthe Tathâgata and all his Bhikshu followers,” the prince, hearing the\nname of Buddha, received at once illumination, and only took one-half\nthe gold, desiring to share in the foundation: “Yours is the land,” he\nsaid, “but mine the trees; these will I give to Buddha as my share in\nthe offering.” Then the noble took the land, Geta the trees, and settled\nboth in trust on Sâriputra. Then they began to build the hall, laboring\nnight and day to finish it. Lofty it rose and choicely decorated, as one\nof the four kings’ palaces, in just proportions, following the\ndirections which Buddha had declared the right ones. Never yet so great\na miracle as this! the priests shone in the streets of Srâvasti!\nTathâgata, seeing the divine shelter, with all his holy ones resorted to\nthe place to rest. No followers there to bow in prostrate service, his\nfollowers rich in wisdom only. The nobleman reaping his reward, at the\nend of life ascended up to heaven, leaving to sons and grandsons a good\nfoundation, through successive generations, to plough the field of\nmerit.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/interview-between-father-and-son/\">Interview between Father and Son</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At this time there was a great householder whose name was “Friend of the\nOrphaned and Destitute”; he was very rich and widely charitable in\nhelping the poor and needy.

In all the six conditions born there is no\nsweet companion like pure charity; if born a Deva or a man, then charity\nbrings worship and renown on every hand; if born among the lower\ncreatures, the result of charity will follow in contentment got; wisdom\nleads the way to fixed composure without dependence and without number,\nand if we even reach the immortal path, still by continuous acts of\ncharity we fulfil ourselves in consequence of kindly charity done\nelsewhere. Training ourselves in the eightfold path of recollection, in\nevery thought the heart is filled with joy; firm fixed in holy\ncontemplation, by meditation still we add to wisdom, able to see aright\nthe cause of birth and death; having beheld aright the cause of these,\nthen follows in due order perfect deliverance. The charitable man\ndiscarding earthly wealth, nobly excludes the power of covetous desire;\nloving and compassionate now, he gives with reverence and banishes all\nhatred, envy, anger. So plainly may we see the fruit of charity, putting\naway all covetous and unbelieving ways, the bands of sorrow all\ndestroyed: this is the fruit of kindly charity. Know then! the\ncharitable man has found the cause of final rescue; even as the man who\nplants the sapling thereby secures the shade, the flowers, the fruit of\nthe tree full grown; the result of charity is even so, its reward is joy\nand the great Nirvâna. The charity which un-stores wealth leads to\nreturns of well-stored fruit. Giving away our food we get more strength,\ngiving away our clothes we get more beauty, founding religious\nrest-places we reap the perfect fruit of the best charity. There is a\nway of giving, seeking pleasure by it; there is a way of giving,\ncoveting to get more; some also give away to get a name for charity,\nothers to get the happiness of heaven, others to avoid the pain of being\npoor hereafter, but yours, O friend! is a charity without such thoughts:\nthe highest and the best degree of charity, without self-interest or\nthought of getting more. What your heart inclines you now to do, let it\nbe quickly done and well completed! The uncertain and the lustful heart\ngoes wandering here and there, but the pure eyes of virtue opening, the\nheart comes back and rests!” The nobleman accepting Buddha’s teaching,\nhis kindly heart receiving yet more light."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"He invited Upatishya, his excellent friend, to accompany him on his\nreturn to Kosala; and then going round to select a pleasant site, he saw\nthe garden of the heir-apparent, Geta, the groves and limpid streams\nmost pure.
