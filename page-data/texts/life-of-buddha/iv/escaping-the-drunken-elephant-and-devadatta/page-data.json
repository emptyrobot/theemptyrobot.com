So also the king of\nGandhâra, whose name was Fo-kia-lo; he, having heard the profound and\nexcellent law, left his country and became a recluse. So also the demons\nHimapati and Vâtagiri, on the mountain Vibhâra, were subdued and\nconverted. The Brahmakârin Prayantika, on the mountain Vagana, by the\nsubtle meaning of half a gâtha, he convinced and caused to rejoice in\nfaith; the village of Dânamati had one Kûtadanta, the head of the\ntwice-born Brahmans; at this time he was sacrificing countless victims;\nTathâgata by means converted him, and caused him to enter the true path.\nOn Mount Bhatika a heavenly being of eminent distinction, whose name was\nPañkasikha, receiving the law, attained Dhyâna; in the village of\nVainushta, he converted the mother of the celebrated Nanda. In the town\nof Añkavari, he subdued the powerful mahâbâla spirit; Bhanabhadra,\nSronadanta, the malevolent and powerful Nâgas, the king of the country\nand his harem, received together the true law, as he opened to them the\ngate of immortality. In the celebrated Viggi village, Kina and Sila,\nearnestly seeking to be born in heaven, he converted and made to enter\nthe right path. The Angulimâla, in that village of Sumu, through the\nexhibition of his divine power, he converted and subdued; there was that\nnoble’s son, Purigîvana, rich in wealth and stores as Punavatî, directly\nhe was brought to Buddha, accepting the doctrine, he became vastly\nliberal. So in that village of Padatti he converted the celebrated\nPatali, and also Patala, brothers, and both demons. In Bhidhavali there\nwere two Brahmans, one called Great-age, the other Brahma-age. These by\nthe power of a discourse he subdued, and caused them to attain knowledge\nof the true law; when he came to Vaisâlî, he converted all the Raksha\ndemons, and the lion of the Likkhavis, and all the Likkhavis, Saka the\nNirgrantha, all these he caused to attain the true law. Hama kinkhava\nhad a demon Potala, and another Potalaka, these he converted. Again he\ncame to Mount Ala, to convert the demon Alava, and a second called\nKumâra, and a third Asidaka; then going back to Mount Gaga he converted\nthe demon Kañgana, and Kamo the Yaksha, with the sister and son. Then\ncoming to Benares, he converted the celebrated Katyâyana; then\nafterwards going, by his miraculous power, to Sruvala, he converted the\nmerchants Davakin and Nikin, and received their sandalwood hall,\nexhaling its fragrant odors till now. Going then to Mahîvatî, he\nconverted the Rishi Kapila, and the Muni remained with him; his foot\nstepping on the stone, the thousand-spoked twin-wheels appeared, which\nnever could be erased.</p>\n<p>Then he came to the place Po-lo-na, where he converted the demon\nPo-lo-na; coming to the country of Mathurâ, he converted the demon\nGodama. In the Thurakusati he also converted Pindapâla; coming to the\nvillage of Vairañga, he converted the Brahman; in the village of\nKalamasa, he converted Savasasin, and also that celebrated Agirivasa.\nOnce more returning to the Srâvastî country, he converted the Gautamas\nGâtisruna and Dakâtili; returning to the Kosala country, he converted\nthe leaders of the heretics Vakrapali and all the Brahmakârins. Coming\nto Satavaka, in the forest retreat, he converted the heretical Rishis,\nand constrained them to enter the path of the Buddha Rishi. Coming to\nthe country of Ayodhyâ, he converted the demon Nâgas; coming to the\ncountry of Kimbila, he converted the two Nâgarâgas; one called Kimbila,\nthe other called Kâlaka. Again coming to the Vaggi country, he converted\nthe Yaksha demon, whose name was Pisha, the father and mother of Nâgara,\nand the great noble also, he caused to believe gladly in the true law.\nComing to the Kausârubî country, he converted Goshira, and the two\nUpasikâs, Vaguttarâ and her companion Uvari; and besides these, many\nothers, one after the other. Coming to the country of Gandhâra he\nconverted the Nâga Apalâla; thus in due order all these air-going,\nwater-loving natures he completely converted and saved, as the sun when\nhe shines upon some dark and sombre cave. At this time Devadatta, seeing\nthe remarkable excellences of Buddha, conceived in his heart a jealous\nhatred; losing all power of thoughtful abstraction he ever plotted\nwicked schemes, to put a stop to the spread of the true law; ascending\nthe Gridhrakûta mount he rolled down a stone to hit Buddha; the stone\ndivided into two parts, each part passing on either side of him. Again,\non the royal highway he loosed a drunken, vicious elephant. With his\nraised trunk trumpeting as thunder he ran, his maddened breath raising a\ncloud around him, his wild pace like the rushing wind, to be avoided\nmore than the fierce tempest; his trunk and tusks and tail and feet,\nwhen touched only, brought instant death. Thus he ran through the\nstreets and ways of Râgagriha, madly wounding and killing men; their\ncorpses lay across the road, their brains and blood scattered afar. Then\nall the men and women filled with fear, remained indoors; throughout the\ncity there was universal terror, only piteous shrieks and cries were\nheard; beyond the city men were running fast, hiding themselves in holes\nand dens. Tathâgata, with five hundred followers, at this time came\ntowards the city; from tops of gates and every window, men, fearing for\nBuddha, begged him not to advance; Tathâgata, his heart composed and\nquiet, with perfect self-possession, thinking only on the sorrow caused\nby hate, his loving heart desiring to appease it, followed by guardian\nangel-nâgas, slowly approached the maddened elephant. The Bhikshus all\ndeserted him, Ânanda only remained by his side; joined by every tie of\nduty, his steadfast nature did not shake or quail. The drunken elephant,\nsavage and spiteful, beholding Buddha, came to himself at once, and\nbending, worshipped at his feet just as a mighty mountain falls to\nearth. With lotus hand the master pats his head, even as the moon lights\nup a flying cloud. And now, as he lay crouched before the master’s feet,\non his account he speaks some sacred words: “The elephant cannot hurt\nthe mighty dragon, hard it is to fight with such a one; the elephant\ndesiring so to do will in the end obtain no happy state of birth;\ndeceived by lust, anger, and delusion, which are hard to conquer, but\nwhich Buddha has conquered. Now, then, this very day, give up this lust,\nthis anger and delusion! You! swallowed up in sorrow’s mud! if not now\ngiven up, they will increase yet more and grow.”</p>\n<p>The elephant, hearing Buddha’s words, escaped from drunkenness, rejoiced\nin heart; his mind and body both found rest, as one athirst finds joy\nwho drinks of heavenly dew. The elephant being thus converted, the\npeople around were filled with joy; they all raised a cry of wonder at\nthe miracle, and brought their offerings of every kind. The\nscarcely-good arrived at middle-virtue, the middling-good passed to a\nhigher grade, the unbelieving now became believers, those who believed\nwere strengthened in their faith. Agâtasatru, mighty king, seeing how\nBuddha conquered the drunken elephant, was moved at heart by thoughts\nprofound; then, filled with joy, he found a twofold growth of piety.\nTathâgata, by exercise of virtue, exhibited all kinds of spiritual\npowers; thus he subdued and harmonized the minds of all, and caused them\nin due order to attain religious truth, and through the kingdom virtuous\nseeds were sown, as at the first when men began to live. But Devadatta,\nmad with rage, because he was ensnared by his own wickedness, at first\nby power miraculous able to fly, now fallen, dwells in lowest hell.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/the-lady-amra-sees-buddha/\">The Lady Âmra Sees Buddha</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Having instructed his mother in heaven with all the angel host, and once\nmore returned to men, he went about converting those capable of it.\nGutika, Gîvaka, Sula, and Kûrna, the noble’s son Anga and the son of the\nfearless king Abhaya Nyagrodha and the rest; Srîkutaka, Upâli the\nNirgrantha; all these were thoroughly converted.
