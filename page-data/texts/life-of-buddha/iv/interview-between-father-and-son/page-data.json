Then\nleaving the city of the five mountains with the company of his thousand\ndisciples, and with a great multitude who went before and came after\nhim, he advanced towards the Ni-kin mountain, near Kapilavastu; and\nthere he conceived in himself a generous purpose to prepare an offering\naccording to his religious doctrine to present to his father, the king.\nAnd now, in anticipation of his coming, the royal teacher and the chief\nminister had sent forth certain officers and their attendants to observe\non the right hand and the left what was taking place; and they soon\nespied him (Buddha) as he advanced or halted on the way. Knowing that\nBuddha was now returning to his country they hastened back and quickly\nannounced the tidings, “The prince who wandered forth afar to obtain\nenlightenment, having fulfilled his aim, is now coming back.” The king\nhearing the news was greatly rejoiced, and forthwith went out with his\ngaudy equipage to meet his son; and the whole body of gentry belonging\nto the country, went forth with him in his company. Gradually advancing\nhe beheld Buddha from afar, his marks of beauty sparkling with splendor\ntwofold greater than of yore; placed in the middle of the great\ncongregation he seemed to be even as Brahma râga. Descending from his\nchariot and advancing with dignity, the king was anxious lest there\nshould be any religious difficulty in the way of instant recognition;\nand now beholding his beauty he inwardly rejoiced, but his mouth found\nno words to utter. He reflected, too, how that he was still dwelling\namong the unconverted throng, whilst his son had advanced and become a\nsaint; and although he was his son, yet as he now occupied the position\nof a religious lord, he knew not by what name to address him.\nFurthermore he thought with himself how he had long ago desired\nearnestly this interview, which now had happened unawares. Meantime his\nson in silence took a seat, perfectly composed and with unchanged\ncountenance. Thus for some time sitting opposite each other, with no\nexpression of feeling the king reflected thus, “How desolate and sad\ndoes he now make my heart, as that of a man, who, fainting, longs for\nwater, upon the road espies a fountain pure and cold; with haste he\nspeeds towards it and longs to drink, when suddenly the spring dries up\nand disappears. Thus, now I see my son, his well-known features as of\nold; but how estranged his heart! and how his manner high and lifted up!\nThere are no grateful outflowings of soul, his feelings seem unwilling\nto express themselves; cold and vacant there he sits; and like a thirsty\nman before a dried-up fountain so am I.”</p>\n<p>Still distant thus they sat, with crowding thoughts rushing through the\nmind, their eyes full met, but no responding joy; each looking at the\nother, seemed as one thinking of a distant friend who gazes by accident\nupon his pictured form. “That you,” the king reflected, “who of right\nmight rule the world, even as that Mândhâtri râga, should now go begging\nhere and there your food! what joy or charm has such a life as this?\nComposed and firm as Sumeru, with marks of beauty bright as the\nsunlight, with dignity of step like the ox king, fearless as any lion,\nand yet receiving not the tribute of the world, but begging food\nsufficient for your body’s nourishment!”</p>\n<p>Buddha, knowing his father’s mind, still kept to his own filial purpose.\nAnd then to open out his mind, and moved with pity for the multitude of\npeople, by his miraculous power he rose in mid-air and with his hands\nappeared to grasp the sun and moon. Then he walked to and fro in space,\nand underwent all kinds of transformation, dividing his body into many\nparts, then joining all in one again. Treading firm on water as on dry\nland, entering the earth as in the water, passing through walls of stone\nwithout impediment, from the right side and the left water and fire\nproduced! The king, his father, filled with joy, now dismissed all\nthought of son and father; then upon a lotus throne, seated in space, he\n(Buddha) for his father’s sake declared the law:—</p>\n<p>“I know that the king’s heart is full of love and recollection, and that\nfor his son’s sake he adds grief to grief; but now let the bands of love\nthat bind him, thinking of his son, be instantly unloosed and utterly\ndestroyed. Ceasing from thoughts of love, let your calmed mind receive\nfrom me, your son, religious nourishment such as no son has offered yet\nto father: such do I present to you the king, my father. And what no\nfather yet has from a son received, now from your son you may accept, a\ngift miraculous for any mortal king to enjoy, and seldom had by any\nheavenly king! The way superlative of life immortal I offer now the\nMahârâga; from accumulated deeds comes birth, and as the result of deeds\ncomes recompense. Knowing then that deeds bring fruit, how diligent\nshould you be to rid yourself of worldly deeds! how careful that in the\nworld your deeds should be only good and gentle! Fondly affected by\nrelationship or firmly bound by mutual ties of love, at end of life the\nsoul goes forth alone—then, only our good deeds befriend us. Whirled in\nthe five ways of the wheel of life, three kinds of deeds produce three\nkinds of birth, and these are caused by lustful hankering, each kind\ndifferent in its character. Deprive these of their power by the practice\nnow of proper deeds of body and of word; by such right preparation, day\nand night strive to get rid of all confusion of the mind and practise\nsilent contemplation; only this brings profit in the end, besides this\nthere is no reality; for be sure! the three worlds are but as the froth\nand bubble of the sea. Would you have pleasure, or would you practise\nthat which brings it near? then prepare yourself by deeds that bring the\nfourth birth: but still the five ways in the wheel of birth and death\nare like the uncertain wandering of the stars; for heavenly beings too\nmust suffer change: how shall we find with men a hope of constancy;\nNirvâna! that is the chief rest; composure! that the best of all\nenjoyments! The five indulgences enjoyed by mortal kings are fraught\nwith danger and distress, like dwelling with a poisonous snake; what\npleasure, for a moment, can there be in such a case? The wise man sees\nthe world as compassed round with burning flames; he fears always, nor\ncan he rest till he has banished, once for all, birth, age, and death.\nInfinitely quiet is the place where the wise man finds his abode; no\nneed of arms or weapons there! no elephants or horses, chariots or\nsoldiers there! Subdued the power of covetous desire and angry thoughts\nand ignorance, there’s nothing left in the wide world to conquer!\nKnowing what sorrow is, he cuts away the cause of sorrow. This\ndestroyed, by practising right means, rightly enlightened in the four\ntrue principles, he casts off fear and escapes the evil ways of birth.”</p>\n<p>The king when first he saw his wondrous spiritual power of miracle\nrejoiced in heart; but now his feelings deeply affected by the joy of\nhearing truth, he became a perfect vessel for receiving true religion,\nand with clasped hands he breathed forth his praise: “Wonderful indeed!\nthe fruit of your resolve completed thus! Wonderful indeed! the\noverwhelming sorrow passed away! Wonderful indeed, this gain to me! At\nfirst my sorrowing heart was heavy, but now my sorrow has brought forth\nonly profit! Wonderful indeed! for now, to-day, I reap the full fruit of\na begotten son. It was right he should reject the choice pleasures of a\nmonarch, it was right he should so earnestly and with diligence practise\npenance; it was right he should cast off his family and kin; it was\nright he should cut off every feeling of love and affection. The old\nRishi kings boasting of their penance gained no merit; but you, living\nin a peaceful, quiet place, have done all and completed all; yourself at\nrest now you give rest to others, moved by your mighty sympathy for all\nthat lives! If you had kept your first estate with men, and as a\nKakravartin monarch ruled the world, possessing then no self-depending\npower of miracle, how could my soul have then received deliverance? Then\nthere would have been no excellent law declared, causing me such joy\nto-day; no! had you been a universal sovereign, the bonds of birth and\ndeath would still have been unsevered, but now you have escaped from\nbirth and death; the great pain of transmigration overcome, you are\nable, for the sake of every creature, widely to preach the law of life\nimmortal, and to exhibit thus your power miraculous, and show the deep\nand wide power of wisdom; the grief of birth and death eternally\ndestroyed, you now have risen far above both gods and men. You might\nhave kept the holy state of a Kakravartin monarch; but no such good as\nthis would have resulted.” Thus his words of praise concluded, filled\nwith increased reverence and religious love, he who occupied the honored\nplace of a royal father, bowed down respectfully and did obeisance. Then\nall the people of the kingdom, beholding Buddha’s miraculous power, and\nhaving heard the deep and excellent law, seeing, moreover, the king’s\ngrave reverence, with clasped hands bowed down and worshipped. Possessed\nwith deep portentous thoughts, satiated with sorrows attached to\nlay-life, they all conceived a wish to leave their homes. The princes,\ntoo, of the Sâkya tribe, their minds enlightened to perceive the perfect\nfruit of righteousness, entirely satiated with the glittering joys of\nthe world, forsaking home, rejoiced to join his company. Ânanda, Nanda,\nKin-pi, Anuruddha, Nandupananda, with Kundadana, all these principal\nnobles and others of the Sâkya family, from the teaching of Buddha\nbecame disciples and accepted the law. The sons of the great minister of\nstate, Udâyin being the chief, with all the royal princes following in\norder became recluses. Moreover, the son of Atalî, whose name was Upâli,\nseeing all these princes and the sons of the chief minister becoming\nhermits, his mind opening for conversion, he, too, received the law of\nrenunciation. The royal father seeing his son possessing the great\nqualities of Riddhi, himself entered on the calm flowings of thought,\nthe gate of the true law of eternal life. Leaving his kingly estate and\ncountry, lost in meditation, he drank sweet dew. Practising his\nreligious duties in solitude, silent and contemplative he dwelt in his\npalace, a royal Rishi. Tathâgata following a peaceable life, recognized\nfully by his tribe, repeating the joyful news of religion, gladdened the\nhearts of all his kinsmen hearing him. And now, it being the right time\nfor begging food, he entered the Kapila country; in the city all the\nlords and ladies, in admiration, raised this chant of praise:\n“Siddhârtha! fully enlightened! has come back again!” The news flying\nquickly in and out of doors, the great and small came forth to see him;\nevery door and every window crowded, climbing on shoulders, bending down\nthe eyes, they gazed upon the marks of beauty on his person, shining and\nglorious! Wearing his Kashâya garment outside, the glory of his person\nfrom within shone forth, like the sun’s perfect wheel; within, without,\nhe seemed one mass of splendor. Those who beheld were filled with\nsympathizing joy; their hands conjoined, they wept for gladness; and so\nthey watched him as he paced with dignity the road, his form collected,\nall his organs well-controlled! His lovely body exhibiting the\nperfection of religious beauty, his dignified compassion adding to their\nregretful joy; his shaven head, his personal beauty sacrificed! his body\nclad in dark and sombre vestment, his manner natural and plain, his\nunadorned appearance; his circumspection as he looked upon the earth in\nwalking! “He who ought to have had held over him the feather-shade,”\nthey said, “whose hands should grasp ‘the reins of the flying dragon,’\nsee how he walks in daylight on the dusty road! holding his alms-dish,\ngoing to beg! Gifted enough to tread down every enemy, lovely enough to\ngladden woman’s heart, with glittering vesture and with godlike crown\nreverenced he might have been by servile crowds! But now, his manly\nbeauty hidden, with heart restrained, and outward form subdued,\nrejecting the much-coveted and glorious apparel, his shining body clad\nwith garments gray, what aim, what object, now! Hating the five delights\nthat move the world, forsaking virtuous wife and tender child, loving\nthe solitude, he wanders friendless; hard, indeed, for virtuous wife\nthrough the long night, cherishing her grief; and now to hear he is a\nhermit! She inquires not now of the royal Suddhodana if he has seen his\nson or not! But as she views his beauteous person, to think his altered\nform is now a hermit’s! hating his home, still full of love; his father,\ntoo, what rest for him! And then his loving child Râhula, weeping with\nconstant sorrowful desire! And now to see no change, or heart-relenting;\nand this the end of such enlightenment! All these attractive marks, the\nproofs of a religious calling, whereas, when born, all said, these are\nmarks of a ‘great man,’ who ought to receive tribute from the four seas!\nAnd now to see what he has come to! all these predictive words vain and\nillusive.”</p>\n<p>Thus they talked together, the gossiping multitude, with confused\naccents. Tathâgata, his heart unaffected, felt no joy and no regret. But\nhe was moved by equal love to all the world, his one desire that men\nshould escape the grief of lust; to cause the root of virtue to\nincrease, and for the sake of coming ages, to leave the marks of\nself-denial behind him, to dissipate the clouds and mists of sensual\ndesire.</p>\n<p>He entered, thus intentioned, on the town to beg. He accepted food both\ngood or bad, whatever came, from rich or poor, without distinction;\nhaving filled his alms-dish, he then returned back to the solitude.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/receiving-the-getavana-vihara/\">Receiving the Getavana Vihâra</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Buddha in the Magadha country employing himself in converting all kinds\nof unbelievers, entirely changed them by the one and self-same law he\npreached, even as the sun drowns with its brightness all the stars.
