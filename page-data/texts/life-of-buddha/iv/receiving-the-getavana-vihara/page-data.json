The Getavana was now\nfully adorned, and its halls and courts carefully prepared. The\nfountains and streams flowed through the garden which glittered with\nflowers and fruit; rare birds sat by the pools, and on the land they\nsang in sweet concord, according to their kind.</p>\n<p>Beautiful in every way as the palace of Mount Kilas, such was the\nGetavana. Then the noble friend of the orphans, surrounded by his\nattendants, who met him on the way, scattering flowers and burning\nincense, invited the lord to enter the Getavana. In his hand he carried\na golden dragon-pitcher, and bending low upon his knees he poured the\nflowing water as a sign of the gift of the Getavana Vihâra for the use\nof the priesthood throughout the world. The lord then received it, with\nthe prayer that “overruling all evil influences it might give the\nkingdom permanent rest, and that the happiness of Anâthapindada might\nflow out in countless streams.” Then the king Prasenagit, hearing that\nthe lord had come, with his royal equipage went to the Getavana to\nworship at the lord’s feet. Having arrived and taken a seat on one side,\nwith clasped hands he spake to Buddha thus:—</p>\n<p>“O that my unworthy and obscure kingdom should thus suddenly have met\nsuch fortune! For how can misfortunes or frequent calamities possibly\naffect it, in the presence of so great a man? And now that I have seen\nyour sacred features, I may perhaps partake of the converting streams of\nyour teaching. A town although it is composed of many sections, yet both\nignoble and holy persons may enter the surpassing stream; and so the\nwind which fans the perfumed grove causes the scents to unite and form\none pleasant breeze; and as the birds which collect on Mount Sumeru are\nmany, and the various shades that blend in shining gold, so an assembly\nmay consist of persons of different capacities: individually\ninsignificant, but a glorious body. The desert master by nourishing the\nRishi, procured a birth as the three leg, or foot star; worldly profit\nis fleeting and perishable, religious profit is eternal and\ninexhaustible; a man though a king is full of trouble, a common man, who\nis holy, has everlasting rest.”</p>\n<p>Buddha knowing the state of the king’s heart—that he rejoiced in\nreligion as Sakrarâga—considered the two obstacles that weighted\nhim—viz., too great love of money and of external pleasures, then\nseizing the opportunity, and knowing the tendencies of his heart, he\nbegan, for the king’s sake, to preach: “Even those who, by evil karma,\nhave been born in low degree, when they see a person of virtuous\ncharacter, feel reverence for him; how much rather ought an independent\nking, who by his previous conditions of life has acquired much merit,\nwhen he encounters Buddha, to conceive even more reverence. Nor is it\ndifficult to understand, that a country should enjoy more rest and\npeace, by the presence of Buddha, than if he were not to dwell therein.\nAnd now, as I briefly declare my law, let the Mahârâga listen and weigh\nmy words, and hold fast that which I deliver! See now the end of my\nperfected merit, my life is done, there is for me no further body or\nspirit, but freedom from all ties of kith or kin! The good or evil deeds\nwe do from first to last follow us as shadows; most exalted then the\ndeeds of the king of the law. The prince who cherishes his people, in\nthe present life gains renown, and hereafter ascends to heaven; but by\ndisobedience and neglect of duty, present distress is felt and future\nmisery! As in old times Lui-‘ma râga, by obeying the precepts, was born\nin heaven, whilst Kin-pu râga, doing wickedly, at the end of life was\nborn in misery. Now then, for the sake of the great king, I will briefly\nrelate the good and evil law. The great requirement is a loving heart!\nto regard the people as we do an only son, not to oppress, not to\ndestroy; to keep in due check every member of the body, to forsake\nunrighteous doctrine and walk in the straight path; not to exalt one’s\nself by treading down others, but to comfort and befriend those in\nsuffering; not to exercise one’s self in false theories, nor to ponder\nmuch on kingly dignity, nor to listen to the smooth words of false\nteachers. Not to vex one’s self by austerities, not to exceed or\ntransgress the right rules of kingly conduct, but to meditate on Buddha\nand weigh his righteous law, and to put down and adjust all that is\ncontrary to religion; to exhibit true superiority by virtuous conduct\nand the highest exercise of reason, to meditate deeply on the vanity of\nearthly things, to realize the fickleness of life by constant\nrecollection; to exalt the mind to the highest point of reflection, to\nseek sincere faith (truth) with firm purpose; to retain an inward sense\nof happiness resulting from one’s self, and to look forward to increased\nhappiness hereafter; to lay up a good name for distant ages, this will\nsecure the favor of Tathâgata, as men now loving sweet fruit will\nhereafter be praised by their descendants. There is a way of darkness\nout of light, there is a way of light out of darkness; there is darkness\nwhich follows after the gloom, there is a light which causes the\nbrightening of light. The wise man, leaving first principles, should go\non to get more light; evil words will be repeated far and wide by the\nmultitude, but there are few to follow good direction: It is impossible,\nhowever, to avoid result of works, the doer cannot escape; if there had\nbeen no first works, there had been in the end no result of doing—no\nreward for good, no hereafter joy; but because works are done, there is\nno escape. Let us then practise good works; let us inspect our thoughts\nthat we do no evil, because as we sow so we reap. As when enclosed in a\nfour-stone mountain, there is no escape or place of refuge for anyone,\nso within this mountain-wall of old age, birth, disease, and death,\nthere is no escape for the world. Only by considering and practising the\ntrue law can we escape from this sorrow-piled mountain. There is,\nindeed, no constancy in the world, the end of the pleasures of sense is\nas the lightning flash, whilst old age and death are as the piercing\nbolts; what profit, then, in doing iniquity! All the ancient conquering\nkings, who were as gods on earth, thought by their strength to overcome\ndecay; but after a brief life they too disappeared. The Kalpa-fire will\nmelt Mount Sumeru, the water of the ocean will be dried up, how much\nless can our human frame, which is as a bubble, expect to endure for\nlong upon the earth! The fierce wind scatters the thick mists, the sun’s\nrays encircle Mount Sumeru, the fierce fire licks up the place of\nmoisture, so things are ever born once more to be destroyed! The body is\na thing of unreality, kept through the suffering of the long night\npampered by wealth, living idly and in carelessness, death suddenly\ncomes and it is carried away as rotten wood in the stream! The wise man,\nexpecting these changes, with diligence strives against sloth; the dread\nof birth and death acts as a spur to keep him from lagging on the road;\nhe frees himself from engagements, he is not occupied with\nself-pleasing, he is not entangled by any of the cares of life, he holds\nto no business, seeks no friendships, engages in no learned career, nor\nyet wholly separates himself from it; for his learning is the wisdom of\nnot-perceiving wisdom, but yet perceiving that which tells him of his\nown impermanence; having a body, yet keeping aloof from defilement, he\nlearns to regard defilement as the greatest evil. He knows that, though\nborn in the Arûpa world, there is yet no escape from the changes of\ntime; his learning, then, is to acquire the changeless body; for where\nno change is, there is peace. Thus the possession of this changeful body\nis the foundation of all sorrow. Therefore, again, all who are wise make\nthis their aim—to seek a bodiless condition; all the various orders of\nsentient creatures, from the indulgence of lust, derive pain; therefore\nall those in this condition ought to conceive a heart, loathing lust;\nputting away and loathing this condition, then they shall receive no\nmore pain; though born in a state with or without an external form, the\ncertainty of future change is the root of sorrow; for so long as there\nis no perfect cessation of personal being, there can be, certainly, no\nabsence of personal desire; beholding, in this way, the character of the\nthree worlds, their inconstancy and unreality, the presence of\never-consuming pain, how can the wise man seek enjoyment therein? When a\ntree is burning with fierce flames how can the birds congregate therein?\nThe wise man, who is regarded as an enlightened sage, without this\nknowledge is ignorant; having this knowledge, then true wisdom dawns;\nwithout it, there is no enlightenment. To get this wisdom is the one\naim, to neglect it is the mistake of life. All the teaching of the\nschools should be centred here; without it is no true reason. To recount\nthis excellent system is not for those who dwell in family connection;\nnor is it, on that account, not to be said, for religion concerns a man\nindividually. Burned up with sorrow, by entering the cool stream, all\nmay obtain relief and ease; the light of a lamp in a dark coom lights up\nequally objects of all colors, so is it with those who devote themselves\nto religion—there is no distinction between the professed disciple and\nthe unlearned. Sometimes the mountain-dweller falls into ruin, sometimes\nthe humble householder mounts up to be a Rishi; the want of faith is the\nengulfing sea, the presence of disorderly belief is the rolling flood.\nThe tide of lust carries away the world; involved in its eddies there is\nno escape; wisdom is the handy boat, reflection is the hold-fast. The\ndrum-call of religion, the barrier of thought, these alone can rescue\nfrom the sea of ignorance.”</p>\n<p>At this time the king, sincerely attentive to the words of the All-wise,\nconceived a distaste for the world’s glitter and was dissatisfied with\nthe pleasures of royalty, even as one avoids a drunken elephant, or\nreturns to right reason after a debauch. Then all the heretical\nteachers, seeing that the king was well affected to Buddha, besought the\nking, with one voice, to call on Buddha to exhibit his miraculous gifts.\nThen the king addressed the lord of the world: “I pray you, grant their\nrequest!” Then Buddha silently acquiesced. And now all the different\nprofessors of religion, the doctors who boasted of their spiritual\npower, came together in a body to where Buddha was; then he manifested\nbefore them his power of miracle: ascending up into the air, he remained\nseated, diffusing his glory as the light of the sun he shed abroad the\nbrightness of his presence. The heretical teachers were all abashed, the\npeople all were filled with faith. Then for the sake of preaching to his\nmother, he forthwith ascended to the heaven of the thirty-three gods,\nand for three months dwelt in heavenly mansions. There he converted the\noccupants of that abode, and having concluded his pious mission to his\nmother, the time of his sojourn in heaven finished, he forthwith\nreturned, the angels accompanying him on wing; he travelled down a\nseven-gemmed ladder, and again arrived at Gambudvîpa. Stepping down he\nalighted on the spot where all the Buddhas return, countless hosts of\nangels accompanied him, conveying with them their palace abodes as a\ngift.</p>\n<p>The people of Gambudvipa, with closed hands, looking up with reverence,\nbeheld him.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/escaping-the-drunken-elephant-and-devadatta/\">Escaping the Drunken Elephant and Devadatta</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The lord of the world, having converted the people of Kapilavastu\naccording to their several circumstances, his work being done, he went\nwith the great body of his followers, and directed his way to the\ncountry of Kosala, where dwelt King Prasenagit.
