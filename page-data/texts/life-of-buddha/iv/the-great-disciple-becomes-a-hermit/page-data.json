Then the king, having perceived\nthe truth, offered his adoration and returned to his palace. The\nworld-honored, with the great congregation, proceeded on foot, to rest\nfor awhile in the bamboo garden. There he dwelt to convert all that\nbreathed, to kindle once for all the lamp of wisdom, to establish Brahma\nand the Devas, and to confirm the lives of saints and sages. At this\ntime Asvagit and Vâshpa, with heart composed and every sense subdued,\nthe time having come for begging food, entered into the town of\nRâgagriha. Unrivalled in the world were they for grace of person, and in\ndignity of carriage excelling all. The lords and ladies of the city\nseeing them, were filled with joy; those who were walking stood still,\nthose before waited, those behind hastened on. Now the Rishi Kapila\namongst all his numerous disciples had one of wide-spread fame, whose\nname was Sâriputra; he, beholding the wonderful grace of the Bhikshus,\ntheir composed mien and subdued senses, their dignified walk and\ncarriage, raising his hands, inquiring, said: “Young in years, but pure\nand graceful in appearance, such as I before have never seen. What law\nmost excellent have you obeyed? and who your master that has taught you?\nand what the doctrine you have learned? Tell me, I pray you, and relieve\nmy doubts.” Then of the Bhikshus, one, rejoicing at his question, with\npleasing air and gracious words, replied: “The omniscient, born of the\nIkshvâku family, the very first ‘midst gods and men, this one is my\ngreat master. I am indeed but young, the sun of wisdom has but just\narisen, how can I then explain the master’s doctrine? Its meaning is\ndeep and very hard to understand, but now, according to my poor wisdom,\nI will recount in brief the master’s doctrine:—‘Whatever things exist\nall spring from cause, the principles of birth and death may be\ndestroyed, the way is by the means he has declared.‘” Then the\ntwice-born Upata, embracing heartily what he had heard, put from him all\nsense-pollution, and obtained the pure eyes of the law. The former\nexplanations he had trusted, respecting cause and what was not the cause\nthat there was nothing that was made, but was made by Isvara; all this,\nnow that he had heard the rule of true causation, understanding the\nwisdom of the no-self, adding thereto the knowledge of the minute dust\ntroubles, which can never be overcome in their completeness but by the\nteaching of Tathâgata, all this he now forever put away; leaving no room\nfor thought of self, the thought of self will disappear. Who, when the\nbrightness of the sun gives light, would call for the dimness of the\nlamp? for, like the severing the lotus, the stem once cut, the pods will\nalso die. “So Buddha’s teaching cutting off the stem of sorrow, no seeds\nare left to grow or lead to further increase.” Then bowing at the\nBhikshu’s feet, with grateful mien, he wended homewards. The Bhikshus\nafter having begged their food, likewise went back to the bamboo grove.\nSâriputra on his arrival home rested with joyful face and full of peace.\nHis friend, the honored Mugalin, equally renowned for learning, seeing\nSâriputra in the distance, his pleasing air and lightsome step, spoke\nthus:—“As I now see thee, there is an unusual look I notice; your\nformer nature seems quite changed, the signs of happiness I now observe,\nall indicate the possession of eternal truth: these marks are not\nuncaused.” Answering he said: “The words of the Tathâgata are such as\nnever yet were spoken,” and then, requested, he declared what he had\nheard. Hearing the words and understanding them, he too put off the\nworld’s defilement, and gained the eyes of true religion, the reward of\na long-planted virtuous cause; and, as one sees by a lamp that comes to\nhand, so he obtained an unmoved faith in Buddha; and now they both set\nout for Buddha’s presence, with a large crowd of followers. Buddha\nseeing the two worthies coming, thus spoke to his disciples:—“These two\nmen who come shall be my two most eminent followers, one unsurpassed for\nwisdom, the other for powers miraculous.” And then with Brahma’s voice,\nprofound and sweet, he forthwith bade them “Welcome!” Here is the pure\nand peaceful law, he said; here the end of all discipleship! Their hands\ngrasping the triple-staff, their twisted hair holding the water-vessel,\nhearing the words of Buddha’s welcome, they forthwith changed into\ncomplete Sramanas; the leaders two and all their followers, assuming the\ncomplete appearance of Bhikshus, with prostrate forms fell down at\nBuddha’s feet, then rising, sat beside him, and with obedient heart\nlistening to the word, they all became Arhats. At this time there was a\ntwice-born sage, Kâsyapa Shi-ming-teng, celebrated and perfect in\nperson, rich in possessions, and his wife most virtuous. But all this he\nhad left and become a hermit, seeking the way of salvation. And now in\nthe way by the To-tseu tower he suddenly encountered Sâkya Muni,\nremarkable for his dignified and illustrious appearance, as the\nembroidered flag of a temple. Respectfully and reverently approaching,\nwith head bowed down, he worshipped his feet, whilst he said: “Truly,\nhonored one, you are my teacher, and I am your follower: much and long\ntime have I been harassed with doubts, oh! would that you would light\nthe lamp of knowledge.” Buddha knowing that this twice-born sage was\nheartily desirous of finding the best mode of escape, with soft and\npliant voice, he bade him come and welcome. Hearing his bidding and his\nheart complying, losing all listlessness of body or spirit, his soul\nembraced the terms of this most excellent salvation. Quiet and calm,\nputting away defilement, the great merciful, as he alone knew how,\nbriefly explained the mode of this deliverance, exhibiting the secrets\nof his law, ending with the four indestructible acquirements. The great\nsage, everywhere celebrated, was called Mahâ Kâsyapa. His original faith\nwas that “body and soul are different,” but he had also held that they\nare the same; that there was both “I” and a place for “I”; but now he\nforever cast away his former faith, and considered only that “sorrow” is\never accumulating; so by removing sorrow there will be “no remains”;\nobedience to the precepts and the practice of discipline, though not\nthemselves the cause, yet he considered these the necessary mode by\nwhich to find deliverance. With equal and impartial mind, he considered\nthe nature of sorrow, for evermore freed from a cleaving heart. Whether\nwe think “this is” or “this is not” he thought, both tend to produce a\nlistless, idle mode of life. But when with equal mind we see the truth,\nthen certainty is produced and no more doubt. If we rely for support on\nwealth or form, then wild confusion and concupiscence result: inconstant\nand impure. But lust and covetous desire removed, the heart of love and\nequal thoughts produced, there can be then no enemies or friends, but\nthe heart is pitiful and kindly disposed to all, and thus is destroyed\nthe power of anger and of hate. Trusting to outward things and their\nrelationships, then crowding thoughts of every kind are gendered.\nReflecting well, and crushing out confusing thought, then lust for\npleasure is destroyed. Though born in the Arûpa world he saw that there\nwould be a remnant of life still left; unacquainted with the four right\ntruths, he had felt an eager longing for this deliverance, for the quiet\nresulting from the absence of all thought. And now putting away forever\ncovetous desire for such a formless state of being, his restless heart\nwas agitated still, as the stream is excited by the rude wind. Then\nentering on deep reflection in quiet he subdued his troubled mind, and\nrealized the truth of there being no “self,” and that therefore birth\nand death are no realities; but beyond this point he rose not: his\nthought of “self” destroyed, all else was lost. But now the lamp of\nwisdom lit, the gloom of every doubt dispersed, he saw an end to that\nwhich seemed without an end; ignorance finally dispelled, he considered\nthe ten points of excellence; the ten seeds of sorrow destroyed, he came\nonce more to life, and what he ought to do, he did. And now regarding\nwith reverence the face of his lord, he put away the three and gained\nthe three; so were there three disciples in addition to the three; and\nas the three stars range around the Trayastrimsas heaven, waiting upon\nthe three and five, so the three wait on Buddha.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/conversion-of-the-supporter-of-the-orphans-and-destitute/\">Conversion of the “Supporter of the Orphans and Destitute”</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At this time Bimbisâra Râga, bowing his head, requested the honored of\nthe world to change his place of abode for the bamboo grove; graciously\naccepting it, Buddha remained silent.
