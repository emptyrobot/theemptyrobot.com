Accordingly proceeding from\nthe city of Râgagriha, he went on towards the town of Pâtaliputra.</p>\n<p>Having arrived there, he dwelt in the famous Pâtali ketiya. Now this\ntown of Pâtaliputra is the frontier town of Magadha, defending the\noutskirts of the country. Ruling the country was a Brahman of wide\nrenown and great learning in the scriptures; and there was also an\noverseer of the country, to take the omens of the land with respect to\nrest or calamity. At this time the king of Magadha sent to that officer\nof inspection a messenger, to warn and command him to raise\nfortifications in the neighborhood of the town for its security and\nprotection. And now the lord of the world, as they were raising the\nfortifications, predicted that in consequence of the Devas and spirits\nwho protected and kept the land, the place should continue strong and\nfree from calamity or destruction. On this the heart of the overseer\ngreatly rejoiced, and he made religious offerings to Buddha, the law,\nand the church. Buddha now leaving the city gate went on towards the\nriver Ganges. The overseer, from his deep reverence for Buddha, named\nthe gate through which the lord had passed the “Gautama gate.” Meanwhile\nthe people all by the side of the river Ganges went forth to pay\nreverence to the lord of the world. They prepared for him every kind of\nreligious offering, and each one with his gaudy boat invited him to\ncross over. The lord of the world, considering the number of the boats,\nfeared lest by an appearance of partiality in accepting one, he might\nhurt the minds of all the rest. Therefore in a moment, by his spiritual\npower, he transported himself and the great congregation across the\nriver, leaving this shore he passed at once to that, signifying thereby\nthe passage in the boat of wisdom from this world to Nirvâna: a boat\nlarge enough to transport all that lives to save the world, even as\nwithout a boat he crossed without hindrance the river Ganges. Then all\nthe people on the bank of the river, with one voice, raised a rapturous\nshout, and all declared this ford should be called the Gautama ford. As\nthe city gate is called the Gautama gate, so this Gautama ford is so\nknown through ages; and shall be so called through generations to come.\nThen Tathâgata, going forward still, came to that celebrated Kuli\nvillage, where he preached and converted many; again he went on to the\nNâdi village, where many deaths had occurred among the people. The\nfriends of the dead then came to the lord and asked, “Where have our\nfriends and relatives deceased, now gone to be born, after this life\nended?” Buddha, knowing well the sequence of deeds, answered each\naccording to his several needs. Then going forward to Vaisâlî, he\nlocated himself in the Âmrâ grove. The celebrated Lady Âmrâ, well\naffected to Buddha, went to that garden followed by her waiting women,\nwhilst the children from the schools paid her respect. Thus with\ncircumspection and self-restraint, her person lightly and plainly\nclothed, putting away all her ornamented robes and all adornments of\nscent and flowers, as a prudent and virtuous woman goes forth to perform\nher religious duties, so she went on, beautiful to look upon, like any\nDevî in appearance. Buddha seeing the lady in the distance approaching,\nspake thus to all the Bhikshus:—</p>\n<p>“This woman is indeed exceedingly beautiful, able to fascinate the minds\nof the religious; now then, keep your recollection straight! let wisdom\nkeep your mind in subjection! Better fall into the fierce tiger’s mouth,\nor under the sharp knife of the executioner, than to dwell with a woman\nand excite in yourselves lustful thoughts. A woman is anxious to exhibit\nher form and shape, whether walking, standing, sitting, or sleeping.\nEven when represented as a picture, she desires most of all to set off\nthe blandishments of her beauty, and thus to rob men of their steadfast\nheart! How then ought you to guard yourselves? By regarding her tears\nand her smiles as enemies, her stooping form, her hanging arms, and all\nher disentangled hair as toils designed to entrap man’s heart. Then how\nmuch more should you suspect her studied, amorous beauty; when she\ndisplays her dainty outline, her richly ornamented form, and chatters\ngayly with the foolish man! Ah, then! what perturbation and what evil\nthoughts, not seeing underneath the horrid, tainted shape, the sorrows\nof impermanence, the impurity, the unreality! Considering these as the\nreality, all lustful thoughts die out; rightly considering these, within\ntheir several limits, not even an Apsaras would give you joy. But yet\nthe power of lust is great with men, and is to be feared withal; take\nthen the bow of earnest perseverance, and the sharp arrow points of\nwisdom, cover your head with the helmet of right-thought, and fight with\nfixed resolve against the five desires. Better far with red-hot iron\npins bore out both your eyes, than encourage in yourselves lustful\nthoughts, or look upon a woman’s form with such desires. Lust beclouding\na man’s heart, confused with woman’s beauty, the mind is dazed, and at\nthe end of life that man must fall into an ‘evil way.’ Fear then the\nsorrow of that ‘evil way!’ and harbor not the deceits of women. The\nsenses not confined within due limits, and the objects of sense not\nlimited as they ought to be, lustful and covetous thoughts grow up\nbetween the two, because the senses and their objects are unequally\nyoked. Just as when two ploughing oxen are yoked together to one halter\nand cross-bar, but not together pulling as they go, so is it when the\nsenses and their objects are unequally matched. Therefore, I say,\nrestrain the heart, give it no unbridled license.”</p>\n<p>Thus Buddha, for the Bhikshus’ sake, explained the law in various ways.\nAnd now that Âmrâ lady gradually approached the presence of the lord;\nseeing Buddha seated beneath a tree, lost in thought and wholly absorbed\nby it, she recollected that he had a great compassionate heart, and\ntherefore she believed he would in pity receive her garden grove. With\nsteadfast heart and joyful mien and rightly governed feelings, her\noutward form restrained, her heart composed, bowing her head at Buddha’s\nfeet, she took her place as the lord bade her, whilst he in sequence\nright declared the law:—</p>\n<p>“Your heart, O lady! seems composed and quieted, your form without\nexternal ornaments; young in years and rich, you seem well-talented as\nyou are beautiful. That one, so gifted, should by faith be able to\nreceive the law of righteousness is, indeed, a rare thing in the world!\nThe wisdom of a master derived from former births, enables him to accept\nthe law with joy: this is not rare; but that a woman, weak of will,\nscant in wisdom, deeply immersed in love, should yet be able to delight\nin piety, this, indeed, is very rare. A man born in the world, by proper\nthought comes to delight in goodness, he recognizes the impermanence of\nwealth and beauty, and looks upon religion as his best ornament. He\nfeels that this alone can remedy the ills of life and change the fate of\nyoung and old; the evil destiny that cramps another’s life cannot affect\nhim, living righteously; always removing that which excites desire, he\nis strong in the absence of desire; seeking to find, not what vain\nthoughts suggest, but that to which religion points him. Relying on\nexternal help, he has sorrow; self-reliant, there is strength and joy.\nBut in the case of woman, from another comes the labor, and the nurture\nof another’s child. Thus then should everyone consider well, and loathe\nand put away the form of woman.”</p>\n<p>Âmrâ, the lady, hearing the law, rejoiced. Her wisdom strengthened, and\nstill more enlightened, she was enabled to cast off desire, and of\nherself dissatisfied with woman’s form, was freed from all polluting\nthoughts. Though still constrained to woman’s form, filled with\nreligious joy, she bowed at Buddha’s feet and spoke: “Oh! may the lord,\nin deep compassion, receive from me, though ignorant, this offering, and\nso fulfil my earnest vow.” Then Buddha knowing her sincerity, and for\nthe good of all that lives, silently accepted her request, and caused in\nher full joy, in consequence; whilst all her friends attentive, grew in\nknowledge, and, after adoration, went back home.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/by-spiritual-power-fixing-his-term-of-years/\">By Spiritual Power Fixing His Term of Years</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The lord of the world having finished his wide work of conversion\nconceived in himself a desire for Nirvana.
