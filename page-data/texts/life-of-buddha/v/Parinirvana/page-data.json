The land that heretofore had peace, was\nnow afflicted and distressed; as when a loving father dies, the orphan\ndaughter yields to constant grief. Her personal grace unheeded, her\nclever skill but lightly thought of, with stammering lips she finds\nexpression for her thoughts; how poor her brilliant wit and wisdom now!\nHer spiritual powers ill regulated without attractiveness, her loving\nheart faint and fickle, exalted high but without strength, and all her\nnative grace neglected; such was the case at Vaisâli; all outward show\nnow fallen, like autumn verdure in the fields bereft of water, withered\nup and dry; or like the smoke of a half-smouldering fire, or like those\nwho having food before them yet forget to eat, so these forgot their\ncommon household duties, and nought prepared they for the day’s\nemergencies. Thinking thus on Buddha, lost in deep reflection, silent\nthey sat nor spoke a word. And now the lion Likkhavis manfully enduring\ntheir great sorrow, with flowing tears and doleful sighs, signifying\nthereby their love of kindred, destroyed forever all their books of\nheresy, to show their firm adherence to the true law. Having put down\nall heresy, they left it once for all; severed from the world and the\nworld’s doctrines, convinced that non-continuance was the great disease.\nMoreover thus they thought: “The lord of men now enters the great quiet\nplace (Nirvâna), and we are left without support, and with no saviour;\nthe highest lord of ‘means’ is now about to extinguish all his glory in\nthe final place of death. Now we indeed have lost our steadfast will, as\nfire deprived of fuel; greatly to be pitied is the world, now that the\nlord gives up his world-protecting office, even as a man bereft of\nspiritual power throughout the world is greatly pitied. Oppressed by\nheat we seek the cooling lake, nipped by the cold we use the fire; but\nin a moment all is lost, the world is left without resource; the\nexcellent law, indeed, is left, to frame the world anew, as a\nmetal-caster frames anew his work. The world has lost its master-guide,\nand, men bereaved of him, the way is lost; old age, disease, and death,\nself-sufficient, now that the road is missed, pervade the world without\na way. What is there now throughout the world equal to overcome the\nsprings of these great sorrows? The great cloud’s rain alone can make\nthe raging and excessive fire, that burns the world, go out. So only he\ncan make the raging fire of covetous desire go out; and now he, the\nskilful maker of comparisons, has firmly fixed his mind to leave the\nworld! And why, again, is the sword of wisdom, ever ready to be used for\nan uninvited friend, only like the draught of wine given to him about to\nundergo the torture and to die? Deluded by false knowledge the mass of\nliving things are only born to die again; as the sharp knife divides the\nwood, so constant change divides the world. The gloom of ignorance like\nthe deep water, lust like the rolling billow, sorrow like the floating\nbubbles, false views like the Makara fish, amidst all these the ship of\nwisdom only can carry us across the mighty sea. The mass of ills are\nlike the flowers of the sorrow-tree, old age and all its griefs, the\ntangled boughs; death the tree’s tap-root, deeds done in life the buds,\nthe diamond sword of wisdom only strong enough to cut down the mundane\ntree! Ignorance the burning-glass, covetous desire the scorching rays,\nthe objects of the five desires the dry grass, wisdom alone the water to\nput out the fire. The perfect law, surpassing every law, having\ndestroyed the gloom of ignorance, we see the straight road leading to\nquietness and rest, the end of every grief and sorrow. And now the\nloving one, converting men, impartial in his thoughts to friend or foe,\nthe all-knowing, perfectly instructed, even he is going to leave the\nworld! He with his soft and finely modulated voice, his compact body and\nbroad shoulders, he, the great Rishi, ends his life! Who then can claim\nexemption? Enlightened, now he quickly passes hence! let us therefore\nseek with earnestness the truth, even as a man meets with the stream\nbeside the road, then drinks and passes on. Inconstancy, this is the\ndreaded enemy—the universal destroyer—sparing neither rich nor poor;\nrightly perceiving this and keeping it in mind, this man, though\nsleeping, yet is the only ever-wakeful.”</p>\n<p>Thus the Likkhavi lions, ever mindful of the Buddha’s wisdom, disquieted\nwith the pain of birth and death, sighed forth their fond remembrance of\nthe man-lion. Retaining in their minds no love of worldly things, aiming\nto rise above the power of every lustful quality, subduing in their\nhearts the thought of light or trivial matters, training their thoughts\nto seek the quiet, peaceful place; diligently practising the rules of\nunselfish, charitable conduct; putting away all listlessness, they found\ntheir joy in quietness and seclusion, meditating only on religious\ntruth. And now the all-wise, turning his body round with a lion-turn,\nonce more gazed upon Vaisâli, and uttered this farewell verse:—</p>\n<p>“Now this, the last time this, I leave Vaisâli—the land where heroes\nlive and flourish! Now am I going to die.” Then gradually advancing,\nstage by stage he came to Bhoga-nagara, and there he rested in the Sâla\ngrove, where he instructed all his followers in the precepts:—</p>\n<p>“Now having gone on high I shall enter on Nirvana: ye must rely upon the\nlaw—this is your highest, strongest, vantage ground. What is not found\nin Sûtra, or what disagrees with rules of Vinaya, opposing the one true\nsystem of my doctrine, this must not be held by you. What opposes\nDharma, what opposes Vinaya, or what is contrary to my words, this is\nthe result of ignorance: ye must not hold such doctrine, but with haste\nreject it. Receiving that which has been said aright, this is not\nsubversive of true doctrine, this is what I have said, as the Dharma and\nVinaya say. Accepting that which I, the law, and the Vinaya declare,\nthis is to be believed. But words which neither I, the law, nor the\nVinaya declare, these are not to be believed. Not gathering the true and\nhidden meaning, but closely holding to the letter, this is the way of\nfoolish teachers, but contrary to my doctrine and a false way of\nteaching. Not separating the true from false, accepting in the dark\nwithout discrimination, is like a shop where gold and its alloys are\nsold together, justly condemned by all the world. The foolish masters,\npractising the ways of superficial wisdom, grasp not the meaning of the\ntruth; but to receive the law as it explains itself, this is to accept\nthe highest mode of exposition. Ye ought, therefore, thus to investigate\ntrue principles, to consider well the true law and the Vinaya, even as\nthe goldsmith does who melts and strikes and then selects the true. Not\nto know the Sûtras and the Sâstras, this is to be devoid of wisdom; not\nsaying properly that which is proper, is like doing that which is not\nfit to see. Let all be done in right and proper order, according as the\nmeaning of the sentence guides, for he who grasps a sword unskilfully,\ndoes but inflict a wound upon his hand. Not skilfully to handle words\nand sentences, the meaning then is hard to know; as in the night-time\ntravelling and seeking for a house, if all be dark within, how difficult\nto find. Losing the meaning, then the law is disregarded, disregarding\nthe law the mind becomes confused; therefore every wise and prudent\nmaster neglects not to discover the true and faithful meaning.”</p>\n<p>Having spoken these words respecting the precepts of religion, he\nadvanced to the town of Pâvâ, where all the Mallas prepared for him\nreligious offerings of every kind. At this time a certain householder’s\nson whose name was Kunda, invited Buddha to his house, and there he gave\nhim, as an offering, his very last repast. Having partaken of it and\ndeclared the law, he onward went to the town of Kusi, crossing the river\nTsae-kieuh and the Hiranyavati. Then in that Sâla grove, a place of\nquiet and seclusion, he took his seat: entering the golden river he\nbathed his body, in appearance like a golden mountain. Then he spake his\nbidding thus to Ânanda: “Between those twin Sâla trees, sweeping and\nwatering, make a clean space, and then arrange my sitting-mat. At\nmidnight coming, I shall die.”</p>\n<p>Ânanda hearing the bidding of his master, his breath was choked with\nheart-sadness; but going and weeping he obeyed the instruction, and\nspreading out the mat he came forthwith back to his master and\nacquainted him. Tathâgata having lain down with his head towards the\nnorth and on his right side, slept thus. Resting upon his hand as on a\npillow with his feet crossed, even as a lion-king; all grief is passed,\nhis last-born body from this one sleep shall never rise. His followers\nround him, in a circle gathered, sigh dolefully: “The eye of the world\nis now put out!” The wind is hushed, the forest streams are silent, no\nvoice is heard of bird or beast. The trees sweat out large flowing\ndrops, flowers and leaves out of season singly fall, whilst men and\nDevas, not yet free from desire, are filled with overwhelming fear. Thus\nwere they like men wandering through the arid desert, the road full\ndangerous, who fail to reach the longed-for hamlet; full of fear they go\non still, dreading they might not find it, their heart borne down with\nfear they faint and droop. And now Tathâgata, aroused from sleep,\naddressed Ânanda thus: “Go! tell the Mallas, the time of my decease is\ncome; they, if they see me not, will ever grieve and suffer deep\nregret.” Ânanda listening to the bidding of his master, weeping went\nalong the road. And then he told those Mallas all—“The lord is near to\ndeath.” The Mallas hearing it, were filled with great, excessive grief.\nThe men and women hurrying forth, bewailing as they went, came to the\nspot where Buddha was; with garments torn and hair dishevelled, covered\nwith dust and sweat they came. With piteous cries they reached the\ngrove, as when a Deva’s day of merit comes to an end, so did they bow\nweeping and adoring at the feet of Buddha, grieving to behold his\nfailing strength. Tathâgata, composed and quiet, spake: “Grieve not! the\ntime is one for joy; no call for sorrow or for anguish here; that which\nfor ages I have aimed at, now am I just about to obtain; delivered now\nfrom the narrow bounds of sense, I go to the place of never-ending rest\nand peace. I leave these things, earth, water, fire, and air, to rest\nsecure where neither birth nor death can come. Eternally delivered there\nfrom grief, oh! tell me! why should I be sorrowful? Of yore on Sirsha’s\nmount, I longed to rid me of this body, but to fulfil my destiny I have\nremained till now with men in the world; I have kept this sickly,\ncrumbling body, as dwelling with a poisonous snake; but now I am come to\nthe great resting-place, all springs of sorrow now forever stopped. No\nmore shall I receive a body, all future sorrow now forever done away; it\nis not meet for you, on my account, for evermore, to encourage any\nanxious fear.”</p>\n<p>The Mallas hearing Buddha’s words, that he was now about to die, their\nminds confused, their eyes bedimmed, as if they saw before them nought\nbut blackness, with hands conjoined, spake thus to Buddha: “Buddha is\nleaving now the pain of birth and death, and entering on the eternal joy\nof rest; doubtless we ought to rejoice thereat. Even as when a house is\nburnt a man rejoices if his friends are saved from out the flames; the\ngods! perhaps they rejoice—then how much more should men! But—when\nTathâgata has gone and living things no more may see him, eternally cut\noff from safety and deliverance—in thought of this we grieve and\nsorrow. Like as a band of merchants crossing with careful steps a\ndesert, with only a single guide, suddenly he dies! Those merchants now\nwithout a protector, how can they but lament! The present age, coming to\nknow their true case, has found the omniscient, and looked to him, but\nyet has not obtained the final conquest; how will the world deride! Even\nas it would laugh at one who, walking o’er a mountain full of treasure,\nyet ignorant thereof, hugs still the pain of poverty.”</p>\n<p>So spake the Mallas, and with tearful words excuse themselves to Buddha,\neven as an only child pleads piteously before a loving father. Buddha\nthen, with speech most excellent, exhibited and declared the highest\nprinciple of truth, and thus addressed the Mallas:—</p>\n<p>“In truth, ‘tis as you say; seeking the way, you must exert yourselves\nand strive with diligence—it is not enough to have seen me! Walk, as I\nhave commanded you; get rid of all the tangled net of sorrow; walk in\nthe way with steadfast aim; ‘tis not from seeing me this comes—even as\na sick man depending on the healing power of medicine, gets rid of all\nhis ailments easily without beholding the physician. He who does not do\nwhat I command sees me in vain, this brings no profit; whilst he who\nlives far off from where I am, and yet walks righteously, is ever near\nme! A man may dwell beside me, and yet, being disobedient, be far away\nfrom me. Keep your heart carefully—give not place to listlessness!\nearnestly practise every good work. Man born in this world is pressed by\nall the sorrows of the long career, ceaselessly troubled—without a\nmoment’s rest, as any lamp blown by the wind!” The Mallas all, hearing\nBuddha’s loving instruction, inwardly composed, restrained their tears,\nand, firmly self-possessed, returned.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/mahaparinirvana/\">Mahâparinirvâna</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When Buddha went towards the place of his Nirvâna, the city of Vaisâli\nwas as if deserted, as when upon a dark and cloudy night the moon and\nstars withdraw their shining.
