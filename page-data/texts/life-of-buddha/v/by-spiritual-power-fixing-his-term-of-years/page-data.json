Accompanied by their body guard surrounding\nthem, they went; others prepared the road in front; and with their\nheavenly crowns and flower-bespangled robes they rode, richly dight with\nevery kind of costly ornament. Their noble forms resplendent increased\nthe glory of that garden grove; now taking off the five distinctive\nornaments, alighting from their chariots, they advanced afoot. Slowly\nthus, with bated breath, their bodies reverent they advanced. Then they\nbowed down and worshipped Buddha’s foot, and, a great multitude, they\ngathered round the lord, shining as the sun’s disc, full of radiance.</p>\n<p>There was the lion Likkhavi, among the Likkhavis the senior, his noble\nform bold as the lion’s, standing there with lion eyes, but without the\nlion’s pride, taught by the Sâkya lion, who thus began: “Great and\nillustrious personages, famed as a tribe for grace and comeliness! put\naside, I pray, the world’s high thoughts, and now accept the abounding\nlustre of religious teaching. Wealth and beauty, scented flowers and\nornaments like these, are not to be compared for grace with moral\nrectitude! Your land productive and in peaceful quiet—this is your\ngreat renown; but true gracefulness of body and a happy people depend\nupon the heart well-governed. Add but to this a reverent feeling for\nreligion, then a people’s fame is at its height! a fertile land and all\nthe dwellers in it, as a united body, virtuous! To-day then learn this\nvirtue, cherish with carefulness the people, lead them as a body in the\nright way of rectitude, even as the ox-king leads the way across the\nriver-ford. If a man with earnest recollection ponder on things of this\nworld and the next, he will consider how by right behavior right morals\nhe prepares, as the result of merit, rest in either world. For all in\nthis world will exceedingly revere him, his fame will spread abroad\nthrough every part, the virtuous will rejoice to call him friend, and\nthe outflowings of his goodness will know no bounds forever. The\nprecious gems found in the desert wilds are all from earth engendered;\nmoral conduct, likewise, as the earth, is the great source of all that\nis good. By this, without the use of wings, we fly through space, we\ncross the river needing not a handy boat; but without this a man will\nfind it hard indeed to cross the stream of sorrow or stay the rush of\nsorrow. As when a tree with lovely flowers and fruit, pierced by some\nsharp instrument, is hard to climb, so is it with the much-renowned for\nstrength and beauty, who break through the laws of moral rectitude!\nSitting upright in the royal palace, the heart of the king was grave and\nmajestic; with a view to gain the merit of a pure and moral life, he\nbecame a convert of a great Rishi. With garments dyed and clad with\nhair, shaved, save one spiral knot, he led a hermit’s life, but, as he\ndid not rule himself with strict morality, he was immersed in suffering\nand sorrow. Each morn and eve he used the three ablutions, sacrificed to\nfire and practised strict austerity, let his body be in filth as the\nbrute beast, passed through fire and water, dwelt amidst the craggy\nrocks, inhaled the wind, drank from the Ganges’ stream, controlled\nhimself with bitter fasts—but all! far short of moral rectitude. For\nthough a man inure himself to live as any brute, he is not on that\naccount a vessel of the righteous law; whilst he who breaks the laws of\nright behavior invites detraction, and is one no virtuous man can love;\nhis heart is ever filled with boding fear, his evil name pursues him as\na shadow. Having neither profit nor advantage in this world, how can he\nin the next world reap content? Therefore the wise man ought to practise\npure behavior; passing through the wilderness of birth and death, pure\nconduct is to him a virtuous guide. From pure behavior comes self-power,\nwhich frees a man from many dangers; pure conduct, like a ladder,\nenables us to climb to heaven. Those who found themselves on right\nbehavior, cut off the source of pain and grief; but they who by\ntransgression destroy this mind, may mourn the loss of every virtuous\nprinciple. To gain this end first banish every ground of ‘self’; this\nthought of ‘self’ shades every lofty aim, even as the ashes that conceal\nthe fire, treading on which the foot is burned. Pride and indifference\nshroud this heart, too, as the sun is obscured by the piled-up clouds;\nsupercilious thoughts root out all modesty of mind, and sorrow saps the\nstrongest will. As age and disease waste youthful beauty, so pride of\nself destroys all virtue; the Devas and Asuras, thus from jealousy and\nenvy, raised mutual strife. The loss of virtue and of merit which we\nmourn, proceeds from ‘pride of self’ throughout; and as I am a conqueror\namid conquerors, so he who conquers self is one with me. He who little\ncares to conquer self, is but a foolish master; beauty, or earthly\nthings, family renown and such things, all are utterly inconstant, and\nwhat is changeable can give no rest of interval. If in the end the law\nof entire destruction is exacted, what use is there in indolence and\npride? Covetous desire is the greatest source of sorrow, appearing as a\nfriend in secret ‘tis our enemy. As a fierce fire excited from within a\nhouse, so is the fire of covetous desire: the burning flame of covetous\ndesire is fiercer far than fire which burns the world. For fire may be\nput out by water in excess, but what can overpower the fire of lust? The\nfire which fiercely burns the desert grass dies out, and then the grass\nwill grow again; but when the fire of lust burns up the heart, then how\nhard for true religion there to dwell! for lust seeks worldly pleasures,\nthese pleasures add to an impure karman; by this evil karman a man falls\ninto perdition, and so there is no greater enemy to man than lust.\nLusting, man gives way to amorous indulgence, by this he is led to\npractise every kind of lustful longing; indulging thus, he gathers\nfrequent sorrow. No greater evil is there than lust. Lust is a dire\ndisease, and the foolish master stops the medicine of wisdom. The study\nof heretical books not leading to right thought, causes the lustful\nheart to increase and grow, for these books are not correct on the\npoints of impermanency, the non-existence of self, and any object ground\nfor ‘self.’ But a true and right apprehension through the power of\nwisdom, is effectual to destroy that false desire, and therefore our\nobject should be to practise this true apprehension. Right apprehension\nonce produced then there is deliverance from covetous desire, for a\nfalse estimate of excellency produces a covetous desire to excel, whilst\na false view of demerit produces anger and regret; but the idea of\nexcelling and also of inferiority (in the sense of demerit) both\ndestroyed, the desire to excel and also anger (on account of\ninferiority) are destroyed. Anger! how it changes the comely face, how\nit destroys the loveliness of beauty! Anger dulls the brightness of the\neye, chokes all desire to hear the principles of truth, cuts and divides\nthe principle of family affection, impoverishes and weakens every\nworldly aim. Therefore let anger be subdued, yield not to the angry\nimpulse; he who can hold his wild and angry heart is well entitled\n‘illustrious charioteer.’ For men call such a one ‘illustrious\nteam-breaker’ who can with bands restrain the unbroken steed; so anger\nnot subdued, its fire unquenched, the sorrow of repentance burns like\nfire. A man who allows wild passion to arise within, himself first burns\nhis heart, then after burning adds the wind thereto which ignites the\nfire again, or not, as the case may be. The pain of birth, old age,\ndisease, and death, press heavily upon the world, but adding ‘passion’\nto the score, what is this but to increase our foes when pressed by\nfoes? But rather, seeing how the world is pressed by throngs of grief,\nwe ought to encourage in us love, and as the world produces grief on\ngrief, so should we add as antidotes unnumbered remedies.” Tathâgata,\nillustrious in expedients, according to the disease, thus briefly spoke;\neven as a good physician in the world, according to the disease,\nprescribes his medicine. And now the Likkhavis, hearing the sermon\npreached by Buddha, arose forthwith and bowed at Buddha’s feet, and\njoyfully they placed them on their heads. Then they asked both Buddha\nand the congregation on the morrow to accept their poor religious\nofferings. But Buddha told them that already Âmrâ had invited him. On\nthis the Likkhavis, harboring thoughts of pride and disappointment,\nsaid: “Why should that one take away our profit?” But, knowing Buddha’s\nheart to be impartial and fair, they once again regained their\ncheerfulness. Tathâgata, moreover, nobly seizing the occasion, appeasing\nthem, produced within a joyful heart; and so subdued, their grandeur of\nappearance came again, as when a snake subdued by charms glistens with\nshining skin. And now, the night being passed, the signs of dawn\nappearing, Buddha and the great assembly go to the abode of Âmrâ, and\nhaving received her entertainment, they went on to the village of\nPi-nau, and there he rested during the rainy season; the three months’\nrest being ended, again he returned to Vaisâli, and dwelt beside the\nMonkey Tank; sitting there in a shady grove, he shed a flood of glory\nfrom his person; aroused thereby, Mâra Pisuna came to the place where\nBuddha was, and with closed palms exhorted him thus: “Formerly, beside\nthe Nairañganâ river, when you had accomplished your true and steadfast\naim, you said, ‘When I have done all I have to do, then will I pass at\nonce to Nirvâna’; and now you have done all you have to do, you should,\nas then you said, pass to Nirvâna.”</p>\n<p>Then Buddha spake to Pisuna: “The time of my complete deliverance is at\nhand, but let three months elapse, and I shall reach Nirvâna.” Then\nMâra, knowing that Tathâgata had fixed the time for his emancipation,\nhis earnest wish being thus fulfilled, joyous returned to his abode in\nheaven. Tathâgata, seated beneath a tree, straightway was lost in\necstasy, and willingly rejected his allotted years, and by his spiritual\npower fixed the remnant of his life. On this, Tathâgata thus giving up\nhis years, the great earth shook and quaked through all the limits of\nthe universe; great flames of fire were seen around, the tops of Sumeru\nwere shaken, from heaven there rained showers of flying stones, a\nwhirling tempest rose on every side, the trees were rooted up and fell,\nheavenly music rose with plaintive notes, whilst angels for a time were\njoyless. Buddha rising from out his ecstasy, announced to all the world:\n“Now have I given up my term of years; I live henceforth by power of\nfaith; my body like a broken chariot stands, no further cause of\n‘coming’ or of ‘going’; completely freed from the three worlds, I go\nenfranchised, as a chicken from its egg.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/the-differences-of-the-likkhavis/\">The Differences of the Likkhavis</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At this time the great men among the Likkhavis, hearing that the lord of\nthe world had entered their country and was located in the Âmrâ garden,\nwent thither riding in their gaudy chariots with silken canopies, and\nclothed in gorgeous robes, both blue and red and yellow and white, each\none with his own cognizance.
