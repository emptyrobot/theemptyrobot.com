Then the Mallas reverencing the body of Tathâgata, trusting to\ntheir martial renown, conceived a haughty mind: “They would rather part\nwith life itself,” they said, “than with the relics of the Buddha”—so\nthose messengers returned from the futile embassage. Then the seven\nkings, highly indignant, with an army numerous as the rain-clouds,\nadvanced on Kusinagara; the people who went from the city filled with\nterror soon returned and told the Mallas all: that the soldiers and the\ncavalry of the neighboring countries were coming, with elephants and\nchariots, to surround the Kusinagara city. The gardens, lying without\nthe town, the fountains, lakes, flower and fruit-trees were now\ndestroyed by the advancing host, and all the pleasant resting-places lay\nin ruins.</p>\n<p>The Mallas, mounting on the city towers, beheld the great supports of\nlife destroyed; they then prepared their warlike engines to crush the\nfoe without: balistas and catapults and “flying torches,” to hurl\nagainst the advancing host. Then the seven kings entrenched themselves\naround the city, each army host filled with increasing courage; their\nwings of battle shining in array as the sun’s seven beams of glory\nshine; the heavy drums rolling as the thunder, the warlike breath rising\nas the full cloud mist. The Mallas, greatly incensed, opening the gates\ncommand the fray to begin; the aged men and women whose hearts had trust\nin Buddha’s law, with deep concern breathed forth their vow, “Oh! may\nthe victory be a bloodless one!” Those who had friends used mutual\nexhortations not to encourage in themselves a desire for strife.</p>\n<p>And now the warriors, clad in armor, grasping their spears and\nbrandishing their swords ‘midst the confused noise and heavy drums\nadvanced. But ere the contest had begun, there was a certain Brahman\nwhose name was Drona, celebrated for penetration, honored for modesty\nand lowliness, whose loving heart took pleasure in religion. This one\naddressed those kings and said: “Regarding the unequalled strength of\nyonder city, one man alone would be enough for its defence; how much\nless when with determined heart they are united, can you subdue it! In\nthe beginning mutual strife produced destruction, how now can it result\nin glory or renown? The clash of swords and bloody onset done, ‘tis\ncertain one must perish! and therefore whilst you aim to vanquish those,\nboth sides will suffer in the fray. Then there are many chances, too, of\nbattle: ‘tis hard to measure strength by appearances; the strong,\nindeed, may overcome the weak, the weak may also overcome the strong;\nthe powerful champion may despise the snake, but how will he escape a\nwounded body? there are men whose natures bland and soft, seem suited\nfor the company of women or of children, but when enlisted in the ranks,\nmake perfect soldiers. As fire when it is fed with oil, though reckoned\nweak, is not extinguished easily, so when you say that they are weak,\nbeware of leaning overmuch on strength of body; nought can compare with\nstrength of right religion. There was in ancient times a Gina king,\nwhose name was Kârandhama, his graceful upright presence caused such\nlove in others that he could overcome all animosity; but though he ruled\nthe world and was high renowned, and rich and prosperous, yet in the end\nhe went back and all was lost! So when the ox has drunk enough, he too\nreturns. Use then the principles of righteousness, use the expedients of\ngood will and love. Conquer your foe by force, you increase his enmity;\nconquer by love, and you will reap no after-sorrow. The present strife\nis but a thirst for blood, this thing cannot be endured! If you desire\nto honor Buddha, follow the example of his patience and long-suffering!”\nThus this Brahman with confidence declared the truth; imbued with\nhighest principles of peace, he spake with boldness and unflinchingly.</p>\n<p>And now the kings addressed the Brahman thus: “You have chosen a fitting\ntime for giving increase to the seed of wisdom: the essence of true\nfriendship is the utterance of truth. The greatest force of reason lies\nin righteous judgment. But now in turn hear what we say: The rules of\nkings are framed to avoid the use of force when hatred has arisen from\nlow desires, or else to avoid the sudden use of violence in trifling\nquestions where some trifling matter is at stake. But we for the sake of\nlaw are about to fight. What wonder is it! Swollen pride is a principle\nto be opposed, for it leads to the overthrow of society; no wonder then\nthat Buddha preached against it, teaching men to practise lowliness and\nhumility. Then why should we be forbidden to pay our reverence to his\nbody-relics? In ancient days a lord of the great earth, Pih-shih-tsung\nand Nanda, for the sake of a beautiful woman fought and destroyed each\nother; how much more now, for the sake of religious reverence to our\nmaster, freed from passion, gone to Nirvâna, without regard to self, or\ncareful of our lives, should we contend and assert our rights! A former\nking, Kaurava, fought with a Pândava king, and the more they increased\nin strength the more they struggled, all for some temporary gain; how\nmuch more for our not-coveting master should we contend, coveting to get\nhis living relics? The son of Râma, too, the Rishi, angry with King\nDasa-ratha, destroyed his country, slew the people, because of the rage\nhe felt; how much less for our master, freed from anger, should we be\nniggard of our lives! Râma, for Sita’s sake, killed all the\ndemon-spirits; how much more for our lord, heaven-received, should we\nnot sacrifice our lives! The two demons A-lai and Po-ku were ever drawn\ninto contention; in the first place, because of their folly and\nignorance, causing wide ruin among men; how much less for our all-wise\nmaster should we begrudge our lives! Wherefore if from these examples we\nfind others ready to die for no real principle, how shall we for our\nteacher of gods (Devas) and men, reverenced by the universe, spare our\nbodies or begrudge our lives, and not be earnest in desire to make our\nofferings! Now then, if you desire to stay the strife, go and for us\ndemand within the city that they open wide the relics, and so cause our\nprayer to be fulfilled. But because your words are right ones, we hold\nour anger for a while; even as the great, angry snake, by the power of\ncharms is quieted.”</p>\n<p>And now the Brahman, having received the kings’ instruction, entering\nthe city, went to the Mallas, and saluting them, spoke these true words:\n“Without the city those who are kings among men grasp with their hands\ntheir martial weapons, and with their bodies clad in weighty armor wait\neagerly to fight; glorious as the sun’s rays, bristling with rage as the\nroused lion. These united are, to overthrow this city. But whilst they\nwage this religious war, they fear lest they may act irreligiously, and\nso they have sent me here to say what they require: ‘We have come, not\nfor the sake of territory, much less for money’s sake, nor on account of\nany insolent feeling, nor yet from any thought of hatred; but because we\nvenerate the great Rishi, we have come on this account. You, noble sirs!\nknow well our mind! Why should there be such sorrowful contention! You\nhonor what we honor, both alike, then we are brothers as concerns\nreligion. We both with equal heart revere the bequeathed spiritual\nrelics of the lord. To be miserly in hoarding wealth, this is an\nunreasonable fault; how much more to grudge religion, of which there is\nso little knowledge in the world! The exclusive and the selfishly\ninclined, should practise laws of hospitality; but if ye have not rules\nof honor such as these, then shut your gates and guard yourselves.’ This\nis the tenor of the words, be they good or bad, spoken by them. But now\nfor myself and my own feelings, let me add these true and sincere\nwords:—Let there be no contention either way; reason ought to minister\nfor peace, the lord when dwelling in the world ever employed the force\nof patience. Not to obey his holy teaching, and yet to offer gifts to\nhim, is contradiction. Men of the world, for some indulgence, some\nwealth or land, contend and fight, but those who believe the righteous\nlaw should obediently conform their lives to it; to believe and yet to\nharbor enmity, this is to oppose ‘religious principle’ to ‘conduct.’\nBuddha himself at rest, and full of love, desired to bestow the rest he\nenjoyed on all. To adore with worship the great merciful, and yet to\ngender wide destruction, how is this possible? Divide the relics, then,\nthat all may worship them alike; obeying thus the law, the fame thereof\nwidespread, then righteous principles will be diffused; but if others\nwalk not righteously, we ought by righteous dealing to appease them, in\nthis way showing the advantage of religion, we cause religion everywhere\nto take deep hold and abide. Buddha has told us that of all charity\n‘religious charity’ is the highest; men easily bestow their wealth in\ncharity, but hard is the charity that works for righteousness.”</p>\n<p>The Mallas hearing the Brahman’s words with inward shame gazed at one\nanother; and answered the Brahmakârin thus: “We thank you much for\npurposing to come to us, and for your friendly and religious\ncounsel—speaking so well, and reasonably. Yours are words which a\nBrahman ought to use, in keeping with his holy character; words full of\nreconciliation, pointing out the proper road; like one recovering a\nwandering horse brings him back by the path which he had lost. We then\nought to adopt the plan of reconciliation such as you have shown us; to\nhear the truth and not obey it brings afterwards regretful sorrow.”</p>\n<p>Then they opened out the master’s relics and in eight parts equally\ndivided them. Themselves paid reverence to one part, the other seven\nthey handed to the Brahman; the seven kings having accepted these,\nrejoiced and placed them on their heads; and thus with them returned to\ntheir own country, and erected Dâgobas for worship over them. The\nBrahmakârin then besought the Mallas to bestow on him the relic-pitcher\nas his portion, and from the seven kings he requested a fragment of\ntheir relics, as an eighth share. Taking this, he returned and raised a\nKaitya, which still is named “the Golden Pitcher Dâgoba.” Then the men\nof Kusinagara collecting all the ashes of the burning, raised over them\na Kaitya, and called it “the Ashes Dâgoba.” The eight Stûpas of the\neight kings, “the Golden Pitcher” and “the Ashes Stûpa.”</p>\n<p>Thus throughout Gambudvipa there first were raised ten Dâgobas. Then all\nthe lords and ladies of the country holding gem-embroidered canopies,\npaid their offerings at the various shrines, adorning them as any golden\nmountain. And so with music and with dancing through the day and night\nthey made merry, and sang. And now the Arhats numbering five hundred,\nhaving forever lost their master’s presence, reflecting there was now no\nground of certainty, returned to Gridhrakûta mount; assembling in King\nSakra’s cavern, they collected there the Sûtra Pitaka; all the assembly\nagreeing that the venerable Ânanda should say, for the sake of the\ncongregation, the sermons of Tathâgata from first to last: “Great and\nsmall, whatever you have heard from the mouth of the deceased Muni.”</p>\n<p>Then Ânanda in the great assembly ascending the lion throne, declared in\norder what the lord had preached, uttering the words “Thus have I\nheard.”</p>\n<p>The whole assembly, bathed in tears, were deeply moved as he pronounced\nthe words “I heard”; and so he announced the law as to the time, as to\nthe place, as to the person; as he spoke, so was it written down from\nfirst to last, the complete Sûtra Pitaka. By diligent attention in the\nuse of means, practising wisdom, all these Arhats obtained Nirvâna;\nthose now able so to do, or hereafter able, shall attain Nirvâna in the\nsame way. King Asoka born in the world when strong, caused much sorrow;\nwhen feeble, then he banished sorrow; as the Asoka-flower tree, ruling\nover Gambudvipa, his heart forever put an end to sorrow, when brought to\nentire faith in the true law; therefore he was called “the King who\nfrees from sorrow.” A descendant of the Mayûra family, receiving from\nheaven a righteous disposition, he ruled equally over the world; he\nraised everywhere towers and shrines, his private name the “violent\nAsoka,” now called the “righteous Asoka.”</p>\n<p>Opening the Dâgobas raised by those seven kings to take the Sarîras\nthence, he spread them everywhere, and raised in one day eighty-four\nthousand towers; only with regard to the eighth pagoda in Râmagrama,\nwhich the Nâga spirit protected, the king was unable to obtain those\nrelics; but though he obtained them not, knowing they were spiritually\nbequeathed relics of Buddha which the Nâga worshipped and adored, his\nfaith was increased and his reverent disposition. Although the king was\nruler of the world, yet was he able to obtain the first holy fruit; and\nthus induced the entire empire to honor and revere the shrines of\nTathâgata.</p>\n<p>In the past and present, thus there has been deliverance for all.\nTathâgata, when in the world; and now his relics—after his Nirvana;\nthose who worship and revere these, gain equal merit; so also those who\nraise themselves by wisdom, and reverence the virtues of the Tathâgata,\ncherishing religion, fostering a spirit of almsgiving, they gain great\nmerit also. The noble and superlative law of Buddha ought to receive the\nadoration of the world. Gone to that undying place, those who believe\nhis law shall follow him there; therefore let all the Devas and men,\nwithout exception, worship and adore the one great loving and\ncompassionate, who mastered thoroughly the highest truth, in order to\ndeliver all that lives. Who that hears of him, but yearns with love! The\npains of birth, old age, disease and death, the endless sorrows of the\nworld, the countless miseries of “hereafter,” dreaded by all the Devas,\nhe has removed all these accumulated sorrows; say, who would not revere\nhim? to escape the joys of after life, this is the world’s chief joy! To\nadd the pain of other births, this is the world’s worst sorrow! Buddha,\nescaped from pain of birth, shall have no joy of the “hereafter”!</p>\n<p>And having shown the way to all the world, who would not reverence and\nadore him? To sing the praises of the lordly monk, and declare his acts\nfrom first to last, without self-seeking or self-honor, without desire\nfor personal renown, but following what the scriptures say, to benefit\nthe world, has been my aim.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thus those Mallas offered religious reverence to the relics, and used\nthe most costly flowers and scents for their supreme act of worship.\nThen the kings of the seven countries, having heard that Buddha was\ndead, sent messengers to the Mallas asking to share the sacred relics of\nBuddha.
