When young he\nhad adopted heretical views, and become a recluse among\nunbelievers—this one, wishing to see the lord, spake to Ânanda thus:—</p>\n<p>“I hear that the system of Tathâgata is of a singular character and very\nprofound, and that he has reached the highest wisdom in the world, the\nfirst of all horse-tamers. I hear moreover that he is now about to die,\nit will be difficult indeed to meet with him again, and difficult to see\nthose who have seen him with difficulty, even as it is to catch in a\nmirror the reflection of the moon. I now desire respectfully to see him\nthe greatest and most virtuous guide of men, because I seek to escape\nthis mass of sorrow and reach the other shore of birth and death. The\nsun of Buddha now about to quench its rays, O! let me for a moment gaze\nupon him.” The feelings of Ânanda now were much affected, thinking that\nthis request was made with a view to controversy, or that he felt an\ninward joy because the lord was on the eve of death. He was not willing\ntherefore to permit the interview with Buddha. Buddha, knowing the man’s\nearnest desire and that he was a vessel fit for true religion, therefore\naddressed Ânanda thus: “Permit that heretic to advance; I was born to\nsave mankind, make no hindrance therefore, or excuse!”</p>\n<p>Subhadra, hearing this, was overjoyed at heart, and his religious\nfeelings were much enlarged, as with increased reverence he advanced to\nBuddha’s presence. Then, as the occasion required, he spoke becoming\nwords and with politeness made his salutation, his features pleasing and\nwith hands conjoined he said:—</p>\n<p>“Now I desire to ask somewhat from thee; the world has many teachers of\nreligion, those who know the law as I am myself; but I hear that Buddha\nhas attained a way which is the end of all complete emancipation. O that\nyou would, on my account, briefly explain your method, moisten my empty,\nthirsty soul! not with a view to controversy or from a desire to gain\nthe mastery, but with sincerity I ask you so to do.”</p>\n<p>Then Buddha, for the Brahmakârin’s sake, in brief recounted the eight\n“right ways”—on hearing which, his empty soul accepted it, as one\ndeceived accepts direction in the right road. Perceiving now, he knew\nthat what he had before perceived was not the final way of salvation,\nbut now he felt he had attained what he had not before attained, and so\nhe gave up and forsook his books of heresy. Moreover, now he rejected\nthe gloomy hindrances of doubt, reflecting how by his former practices,\nmixed up with anger, hate, and ignorance, he had long cherished no real\njoy. For if, he argued, the ways of lust and hate and ignorance are able\nto produce a virtuous karman, then “hearing much” and “persevering\nwisdom,” these, too, are born from lust, which cannot be. But if a man\nis able to cut down hate and ignorance, then also he puts off all\nconsequences of works, and these being finally destroyed, this is\ncomplete emancipation. Those thus freed from works are likewise freed\nfrom subtle questionings, such as what the world says “that all things,\neverywhere, possess a self-nature.” But if this be the case and\ntherefore lust, hate, and ignorance, possess a self-implanted nature,\nthen this nature must inhere in them; what then means the word\n“deliverance”? For even if we rightly cause the overthrow of hate and\nignorance, yet if lust remains, then there is a return of birth; even as\nwater, cold in its nature, may by fire be heated, but when the fire goes\nout then it becomes cold again, because this is its constant nature; so\nwe may ever know that the nature which lust has is permanent, and\nneither hearing wisdom nor perseverance can alter it. Neither capable of\nincrease or diminution, how can there be deliverance? I held aforetime\nthat birth and death resulted thus, from their own innate nature; but\nnow I see that such a belief excludes deliverance; for what is born by\nnature must endure so, what end can such things have? Just as a burning\nlamp cannot but give its light; the way of Buddha is the only true one,\nthat lust, as the root-cause, brings forth the things that live; destroy\nthis lust then there is Nirvana; the cause destroyed then the fruit is\nnot produced. I formerly maintained that “I” was a distinct entity, not\nseeing that it has no maker. But now I hear the right doctrine preached\nby Buddha, there is no “self” in all the world, for all things are\nproduced by cause, and therefore there is no creator. If then sorrow is\nproduced by cause, the cause may likewise be destroyed; for if the world\nis cause-produced, then is the view correct, that by destruction of the\ncause, there is an end. The cause destroyed, the world brought to an\nend, there is no room for such a thought as permanence, and therefore\nall my former views are “done away,” and so he deeply “saw” the true\ndoctrine taught by Buddha.</p>\n<p>Because of seeds well sown in former times, he was enabled thus to\nunderstand the law on hearing it; thus he reached the good and perfect\nstate of quietness, the peaceful, never-ending place of rest. His heart\nexpanding to receive the truth, he gazed with earnest look on Buddha as\nhe slept, nor could he bear to see Tathâgata depart and die; “ere yet,”\nhe said, “Buddha shall reach the term I will myself first leave the\nworld;” and then with hands close joined, retiring from the holy form,\nhe took his seat apart, and sat composed and firm. Then giving up his\nlife, he reached Nirvâna, as when the rain puts out a little fire. Then\nBuddha spake to all his followers: “This my very last disciple has now\nattained Nirvâna, cherish him properly.”</p>\n<p>Then Buddha, the first night watch passed, the moon bright shining and\nall the stars clear in their lustre, the quiet grove without a sound,\nmoved by his great compassionate heart, declared to his disciples this\nhis bequeathed precepts: “After my Nirvâna, ye ought to reverence and\nobey the Pratimoksha, as your master, a shining lamp in the dark night,\nor as a great jewel treasured by a poor man. These injunctions I have\never given, these you ought to obey and follow carefully, and treat in\nno way different from myself. Keep pure your body, words, and conduct,\nput from you all concerns of daily life, lands, houses, cattle, storing\nwealth or hoarding grain. All these should be avoided as we avoid a\nfiery pit; sowing the land, cutting down shrubs, healing of wounds or\nthe practice of medicine, star-gazing and astrology, forecasting lucky\nor unfortunate events by signs, prognosticating good or evil, all these\nare things forbidden. Keeping the body temperate, eat at proper times;\nreceive no mission as a go-between; compound no philteries; abhor\ndissimulation; follow right doctrine, and be kind to all that lives;\nreceive in moderation what is given; receive but hoard not up; these\nare, in brief, my spoken precepts. These form the groundwork of my\nrules, these also are the ground of full emancipation. Enabled thus to\nlive this is rightly to receive all other things. This is true wisdom\nwhich embraces all, this is the way to attain the end; this code of\nrules, therefore, ye should hold and keep, and never let it slip or be\ndestroyed. For when pure rules of conduct are observed then there is\ntrue religion; without these, virtue languishes; found yourselves\ntherefore well on these my precepts; grounded thus in rules of purity,\nthe springs of feeling will be well controlled, even as the\nwell-instructed cow-herd guides well his cattle. Ill-governed feelings,\nlike the horse, run wild through all the six domains of sense, bringing\nupon us in the present world unhappiness, and in the next, birth in an\nevil way. So, like the horse ill-broken, these land us in the ditch;\ntherefore the wise and prudent man will not allow his senses license.\nFor these senses are, indeed, our greatest foes, causes of misery; for\nmen enamoured thus by sensuous things cause all their miseries to recur.\nDestructive as a poisonous snake, or like a savage tiger, or like a\nraging fire, the greatest evil in the world, he who is wise, is freed\nfrom fear of these. But what he fears is only this—a light and trivial\nheart, which drags a man to future misery—just for a little sip of\npleasure, not looking at the yawning gulf before us; like the wild\nelephant freed from the iron curb, or like the ape that has regained the\nforest trees, such is the light and trivial heart; the wise man should\nrestrain and hold it therefore. Letting the heart go loose without\nrestraint, that man shall not attain Nirvâna; therefore we ought to hold\nthe heart in check, and go apart from men and seek a quiet\nresting-place. Know when to eat and the right measure; and so with\nreference to the rules of clothing and of medicine; take care you do not\nby the food you take, encourage in yourselves a covetous or an angry\nmind. Eat your food to satisfy your hunger and drink to satisfy your\nthirst, as we repair an old or broken chariot, or like the butterfly\nthat sips the flower destroying not its fragrance or its texture. The\nBhikshu, in begging food, should beware of injuring the faithful mind of\nanother; if a man opens his heart in charity, think not about his\ncapabilities, for ‘tis not well to calculate too closely the strength of\nthe ox, lest by loading him beyond his strength you cause him injury. At\nmorning, noon, and night, successively, store up good works. During the\nfirst and after-watch at night be not overpowered by sleep, but in the\nmiddle watch, with heart composed, take sleep and rest—be thoughtful\ntowards the dawn of day. Sleep not the whole night through, making the\nbody and the life relaxed and feeble; think! when the fire shall burn\nthe body always, what length of sleep will then be possible? For when\nthe hateful brood of sorrow rising through space, with all its attendant\nhorrors, meeting the mind o’erwhelmed by sleep and death, shall seize\nits prey, who then shall waken it?</p>\n<p>“The poisonous snake dwelling within a house can be enticed away by\nproper charms, so the black toad that dwells within his heart, the early\nwaker disenchants and banishes. He who sleeps on heedlessly without\nplan, this man has no modesty; but modesty is like a beauteous robe, or\nlike the curb that guides the elephant. Modest behavior keeps the heart\ncomposed, without it every virtuous root will die. Who has this modesty,\nthe world applauds; without it, he is but as any beast. If a man with a\nsharp sword should cut the body bit by bit, let not an angry thought, or\nof resentment, rise, and let the mouth speak no ill word. Your evil\nthoughts and evil words but hurt yourself and not another; nothing so\nfull of victory as patience, though your body suffer the pain of\nmutilation. For recollect that he who has this patience cannot be\novercome, his strength being so firm; therefore give not way to anger or\nevil words towards men in power. Anger and hate destroy the true law;\nand they destroy dignity and beauty of body; as when one dies we lose\nour name for beauty, so the fire of anger itself burns up the heart.\nAnger is foe to all religious merit, he who loves virtue let him not be\npassionate; the layman who is angry when oppressed by many sorrows is\nnot wondered at. But he who has ‘left his home’ indulging anger, this is\nindeed opposed to principle, as if in frozen water there were found the\nheat of fire. If indolence arises in your heart, then with your own hand\nsmooth down your head, shave off your hair, and clad in sombre garments,\nin your hand holding the begging-pot, go ask for food; on every side the\nliving perish, what room for indolence? the worldly man, relying on his\nsubstance or his family, indulging in indolence, is wrong; how much more\nthe religious man, whose purpose is to seek the way of rescue, who\nencourages within an indolent mind; this surely is impossible!</p>\n<p>“Crookedness and straightness are in their nature opposite and cannot\ndwell together more than frost and fire; for one who has become\nreligious, and practises the way of straight behavior, a false and\ncrooked way of speech is not becoming. False and flattering speech is\nlike the magician’s art; but he who ponders on religion cannot speak\nfalsely. To ‘covet much,’ brings sorrow; desiring little, there is rest\nand peace. To procure rest, there must be small desire—much more in\ncase of those who seek salvation. The niggard dreads the much-seeking\nman lest he should filch away his property, but he who loves to give has\nalso fear, lest he should not possess enough to give; therefore we ought\nto encourage small desire, that we may have to give to him who wants,\nwithout such fear. From this desiring-little-mind we find the way of\ntrue deliverance; desiring true deliverance we ought to practise\nknowing-enough contentment.</p>\n<p>“A contented mind is always joyful, but joy like this is but religion;\nthe rich and poor alike, having contentment, enjoy perpetual rest. The\nill-contented man, though he be born to heavenly joys, because he is not\ncontented would ever have a mind burned up by the fire of sorrow. The\nrich, without contentment, endures the pain of poverty; though poor, if\nyet he be contented, then he is rich indeed! That ill-contented man, the\nbounds of the five desires extending further still, becomes insatiable\nin his requirements, and so through the long night of life gathers\nincreasing sorrow. Without cessation thus he cherishes his careful\nplans, whilst he who lives contented, freed from anxious thoughts about\nrelationships, his heart is ever peaceful and at rest. And so because he\nrests and is at peace within, the gods and men revere and do him\nservice. Therefore we ought to put away all cares about relationship.</p>\n<p>“For like a solitary desert tree in which the birds and monkeys gather,\nso is it when we are cumbered much with family associations; through the\nlong night we gather many sorrows. Many dependents are like the many\nbands that bind us, or like the old elephant that struggles in the mud.\nBy diligent perseverance a man may get much profit; therefore night and\nday men ought with ceaseless effort to exert themselves; the tiny\nstreams that trickle down the mountain slopes by always flowing eat away\nthe rock. If we use not earnest diligence in drilling wood in wood for\nfire, we shall not obtain the spark, so ought we to be diligent and\npersevere, as the skilful master drills the wood for fire. A ‘virtuous\nfriend’ though he be gentle is not to be compared with right\nreflection—right thought kept well in the mind, no evil thing can ever\nenter there.</p>\n<p>“Wherefore those who practise a religious life should always think about\n‘the body’; if thought upon one’s self be absent, then all virtue dies.\nFor as the champion warrior relies for victory upon his armor’s\nstrength, so ‘right thought’ is like a strong cuirass, able to withstand\nthe six sense-robbers. Right faith enwraps the enlightened heart, so\nthat a man perceives the world throughout is liable to birth and death;\ntherefore the religious man should practise faith.</p>\n<p>“Having found peace in faith, we put an end to all the mass of sorrows,\nwisdom then can enlighten us, and so we put away the rules by which we\nacquire knowledge by the senses. By inward thought and right\nconsideration following with gladness the directions of the ‘true law,’\nthis is the way in which both laymen of the world and men who have left\ntheir homes should walk.</p>\n<p>“Across the sea of birth and death, ‘wisdom’ is the handy bark; ‘wisdom’\nis the shining lamp that lightens up the dark and gloomy world. ‘Wisdom’\nis the grateful medicine for all the defiling ills of life; ‘wisdom’ is\nthe axe wherewith to level all the tangled forest trees of sorrow.\n‘Wisdom’ is the bridge that spans the rushing stream of ignorance and\nlust—therefore, in every way, by thought and right attention, a man\nshould diligently inure himself to engender wisdom. Having acquired the\nthreefold wisdom, then, though blind, the eye of wisdom sees throughout;\nbut without wisdom the mind is poor and insincere; such things cannot\nsuit the man who has left his home.</p>\n<p>“Wherefore let the enlightened man lay well to heart that false and\nfruitless things become him not, and let him strive with single mind for\nthat pure joy which can be found alone in perfect rest and quietude.</p>\n<p>“Above all things be not careless, for carelessness is the chief foe of\nvirtue; if a man avoid this fault he may be born where Sakra-râga\ndwells. He who gives way to carelessness of mind must have his lot where\nthe Asuras dwell. Thus have I done my task, my fitting task, in setting\nforth the way of quietude, the proof of love. On your parts be diligent!\nwith virtuous purpose practise well these rules, in quiet solitude of\ndesert hermitage nourish and cherish a still and peaceful heart. Exert\nyourselves to the utmost, give no place to remissness, for as in worldly\nmatters when the considerate physician prescribes fit medicine for the\ndisease he has detected, should the sick man neglect to use it, this\ncannot be the physician’s fault, so I have told you the truth, and set\nbefore you this the one and level road. Hearing my words and not with\ncare obeying them, this is not the fault of him who speaks; if there be\nanything not clearly understood in the principles of the ‘four truths,’\nyou now may ask me, freely; let not your inward thoughts be longer hid.”\nThe lord in mercy thus instructing them, the whole assembly remained\nsilent.</p>\n<p>Then Anuruddha, observing that the great congregation continued silent\nand expressed no doubt, with closed hands thus spake to Buddha:—</p>\n<p>“The moon may be warm, the sun’s rays be cool, the air be still, the\nearth’s nature mobile; these four things, though yet unheard of in the\nworld, may happen; but this assembly never can have doubt about the\nprinciples of sorrow, accumulation, destruction, and the\nincontrovertible truths, as declared by the lord. But because the lord\nis going to die, we all have sorrow; and we cannot raise our thoughts to\nthe high theme of the lord’s preaching. Perhaps some fresh disciple,\nwhose feelings are yet not entirely freed from other influences might\ndoubt; but we, who now have heard this tender, sorrowful discourse, have\naltogether freed ourselves from doubt. Passed the sea of birth and\ndeath, without desire, with nought to seek, we only know how much we\nlove, and, grieving, ask why Buddha dies so quickly?”</p>\n<p>Buddha regarding Anuruddha, perceiving how his words were full of\nbitterness, again with loving heart, appeasing him, replied:—</p>\n<p>“In the beginning things were fixed, in the end again they separate;\ndifferent combinations cause other substances, for there is no uniform\nand constant principle in nature. But when all mutual purposes be\nanswered, what then shall chaos and creation do! the gods and men alike\nthat should be saved, shall all have been completely saved! Ye then! my\nfollowers, who know so well the perfect law, remember! the end must\ncome; give not way again to sorrow!</p>\n<p>“Use diligently the appointed means; aim to reach the home where\nseparation cannot come; I have lit the lamp of wisdom, its rays alone\ncan drive away the gloom that shrouds the world. The world is not\nforever fixed! Ye should rejoice therefore! as when a friend, afflicted\ngrievously, his sickness healed, escapes from pain. For I have put away\nthis painful vessel, I have stemmed the flowing sea of birth and death,\nfree forever now, from pain! for this you should exult with joy! Now\nguard yourselves aright, let there be no remissness! that which exists\nwill all return to nothingness! and now I die. From this time forth my\nwords are done, this is my very last instruction.”</p>\n<p>Then entering the Samâdhi of the first Dhyâna, he went successively\nthrough all the nine in a direct order; then inversely he returned\nthroughout and entered on the first, and then from the first he raised\nhimself and entered on the fourth. Leaving the state of Samâdhi, his\nsoul without a resting-place, forthwith he reached Nirvâna. And then, as\nBuddha died, the great earth quaked throughout. In space, on every hand,\nwas fire like rain, no fuel, self-consuming. And so from out the earth\ngreat flames arose on every side.</p>\n<p>Thus up to the heavenly mansions flames burst forth; the crash of\nthunder shook the heavens and earth, rolling along the mountains and the\nvalleys, even as when the Devas and Asuras fight with sound of drums and\nmutual conflict. A wind tempestuous from the four bounds of earth\narose—whilst from the crags and hills, dust and ashes fell like rain.\nThe sun and moon withdrew their shining; the peaceful streams on every\nside were torrent-swollen; the sturdy forests shook like aspen leaves,\nwhilst flowers and leaves untimely fell around, like scattered rain. The\nflying dragons, carried on pitchy clouds, wept down their tears; the\nfour kings and their associates, moved by pity, forgot their works of\ncharity. The pure Devas came to earth from heaven, halting mid-air they\nlooked upon the changeful scene, not sorrowing, not rejoicing. But yet\nthey sighed to think of the world, heedless of its sacred teacher,\nhastening to destruction. The eightfold heavenly spirits, on every side\nfilled space: cast down at heart and grieving, they scattered flowers as\nofferings. Only Mâra-râga rejoiced, and struck up sounds of music in his\nexultation. Whilst Gambudvipa shorn of its glory, seemed to grieve as\nwhen the mountain tops fall down to earth, or like the great elephant\nrobbed of its tusks, or like the ox-king spoiled of his horns; or heaven\nwithout the sun and moon, or as the lily beaten by the hail; thus was\nthe world bereaved when Buddha died!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/praising-nirvana/\">Praising Nirvâna</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At this time there was a Brahmakârin whose name was Su-po-to-lo; he was\nwell-known for his virtuous qualities, leading a pure life according to\nthe rules of morality, and protecting all living things.

Eat your food to satisfy your hunger and drink to satisfy your\nthirst, as we repair an old or broken chariot, or like the butterfly\nthat sips the flower destroying not its fragrance or its texture. The\nBhikshu, in begging food, should beware of injuring the faithful mind of\nanother; if a man opens his heart in charity, think not about his\ncapabilities, for ‘tis not well to calculate too closely the strength of\nthe ox, lest by loading him beyond his strength you cause him injury. At\nmorning, noon, and night, successively, store up good works. During the\nfirst and after-watch at night be not overpowered by sleep, but in the\nmiddle watch, with heart composed, take sleep and rest—be thoughtful\ntowards the dawn of day. Sleep not the whole night through, making the\nbody and the life relaxed and feeble; think! when the fire shall burn\nthe body always, what length of sleep will then be possible? For when\nthe hateful brood of sorrow rising through space, with all its attendant\nhorrors, meeting the mind o’erwhelmed by sleep and death, shall seize\nits prey, who then shall waken it?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“The poisonous snake dwelling within a house can be enticed away by\nproper charms, so the black toad that dwells within his heart, the early\nwaker disenchants and banishes.
