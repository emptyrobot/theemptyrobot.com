This\none, for the universal benefit of the Deva assembly, sounded forth at\nlarge these verses on impermanence:—</p>\n<p>“Impermanency is the nature of all things, quickly born, they quickly\ndie. With birth there comes the rush of sorrows, only in Nirvâna is\nthere joy. The accumulated fuel heaped up by the power of karman, this\nthe fire of wisdom alone can consume. Though the fame of our deeds reach\nup to heaven as smoke, yet in time the rains which descend will\nextinguish all, as the fire that rages at the kalpa’s end is put out by\nthe judgment of water.”</p>\n<p>Again there was a Brahma-Rishi-deva, like a most exalted Rishi, dwelling\nin heaven, possessed of superior happiness, with no taint in his bliss,\nwho thus sighed forth his praises of Tathâgata’s Nirvâna, with his mind\nfixed in abstraction as he spoke:</p>\n<p>“Looking through all the conditions of life, from first to last nought\nis free from destruction. But the incomparable seer dwelling in the\nworld, thoroughly acquainted with the highest truth, whose wisdom grasps\nthat which is beyond the world’s ken, he it is who can save the\nworldly-dwellers. He it is who can provide lasting escape from the\ndestructive power of impermanence. But, alas! through the wide world,\nall that lives is sunk in unbelief.”</p>\n<p>At this time Anuruddha, “not stopped” by the world, “not stopped” from\nbeing delivered, the stream of birth and death forever “stopped,” sighed\nforth the praises of Tathâgata’s Nirvâna:—</p>\n<p>“All living things completely blind and dark! the mass of deeds all\nperishing, even as the fleeting cloud-pile! Quickly arising and as\nquickly perishing! the wise man holds not to such a refuge, for the\ndiamond mace of inconstancy can overturn the mountain of the Rishi\nhermit. How despicable and how weak the world! doomed to destruction,\nwithout strength! Impermanence, like the fierce lion, can even spoil the\nNâga-elephant-great-Rishi. Only the diamond curtain of Tathâgata can\noverwhelm inconstancy! How much more should those not yet delivered from\ndesire, fear and dread its power? From the six seeds there grows one\nsprout, one kind of water from the rain, the origin of the four points\nis far removed: five kinds of fruit from the two ‘Koo’—the three\nperiods, past, present, future, are but one in substance; the\nMuni-great-elephant plucks up the great tree of sorrow, and yet he\ncannot avoid the power of impermanence. For like the crested bird\ndelights within the pool to seize the poisonous snake, but when from\nsudden drought he is left in the dry pool, he dies; or as the prancing\nsteed advances fearlessly to battle, but when the fight has passed goes\nback subdued and quiet; or as the raging fire burns with the fuel, but\nwhen the fuel is done, expires; so is it with Tathâgata, his task\naccomplished he returns to find his refuge in Nirvâna: just as the\nshining of the radiant moon sheds everywhere its light and drives away\nthe gloom, all creatures grateful for its light, it disappears concealed\nby Sumeru; such is the case with Tathâgata, the brightness of his wisdom\nlit up the gloomy darkness, and for the good of all that lives drove it\naway, when suddenly it disappears behind the mountain of Nirvâna. The\nsplendor of his fame throughout the world diffused, had banished all\nobscurity, but like the stream that ever flows, it rests not with us;\nthe illustrious charioteer with his seven prancing steeds flies through\nthe host and disappears.</p>\n<p>“The bright-rayed Sûrya-deva, entering the Yen-tsz’ cave, was, with the\nmoon, surrounded with fivefold barriers; ‘all things that live,’\ndeprived of light, present their offerings to heaven; but from their\nsacrifice nought but the blackened smoke ascends; thus it is with\nTathâgata, his glory hidden, the world has lost its light. Rare was the\nexpectancy of grateful love that filled the heart of all that lives;\nthat love, reached its full limit, then was left to perish! The cords of\nsorrow all removed, we found the true and only way; but now he leaves\nthe tangled mesh of life, and enters on the quiet place! His spirit\nmounting through space, he leaves the sorrow-bearing vessel of his body!\nthe gloom of doubt and the great darkness all dispelled, by the bright\nrays of wisdom! The earthy soil of sorrow’s dust his wisdom’s water\npurifies! no more, no more, returns he here! forever gone to the place\nof rest!</p>\n<p>“The power of birth and death destroyed, the world instructed in the\nhighest doctrine! he bids the world rejoice in knowledge of his law, and\ngives to all the benefit of wisdom! Giving complete rest to the world,\nthe virtuous streams flow forth! his fame known throughout the world,\nshines still with increased splendor! How great his pity and his love to\nthose who opposed his claims, neither rejoicing in their defeat nor\nexulting in his own success. Illustriously controlling his feelings, all\nhis senses completely enlightened, his heart impartially observing\nevents, unpolluted by the six objects of sense! Reaching to that\nunreached before! obtaining that which man had not obtained! with the\nwater which he provided filling every thirsty soul! Bestowing that which\nnever yet was given, and providing a reward not hoped for! his peaceful,\nwell-marked person, perfectly knowing the thoughts of all.</p>\n<p>“Not greatly moved either by loving or disliking! overcoming all enemies\nby the force of his love! the welcome physician for all diseases, the\none destroyer of impermanency! All living things rejoicing in religion,\nfully satisfied! obtaining all they need, their every wish fulfilled!\nThe great master of holy wisdom once gone returns no more! even as the\nfire gone out for want of fuel! Declaring the eight rules without taint;\novercoming the five senses, difficult to compose! with the three powers\nof sight seeing the three precious ones; removing the three robbers\n(i.e. lust, anger, ignorance); perfecting the three grades of a holy\nlife, concealing the one (himself) and obtaining the one\nsaintship—leaping over the seven ‘bodhyangas’ and obtaining the long\nsleep; the end of all, the quiet, peaceful way; the highest prize of\nsages and of saints!</p>\n<p>“Having himself severed the barriers of sorrow, now he is able to save\nhis followers, and to provide the draught of immortality for all who are\nparched with thirst! Armed with the heavy cuirass of patience, he has\novercome all enemies! by the subtle principles of his excellent law to\nsatisfy every heart. Planting a sacred seed in the hearts of those\npractising virtue; impartially directing and not casting off those who\nare right or not right in their views! Turning the wheel of the\nsuperlative law! received with gladness through the world by those who\nhave in former conditions implanted in themselves a love for religion,\nthese all saved by his preaching! Going forth among men converting those\nnot yet converted; those who had not seen the truth, causing them to see\nthe truth! All those practising a false method of religion, delivering\nto them deep principles of his religion! preaching the doctrines of\nbirth and death and impermanency; declaring that without a master\nteacher there can be no happiness! Erecting the standard of his great\nrenown, overcoming and destroying the armies of Mâra! advancing to the\npoint of indifference to pleasure or pain, caring not for life, desiring\nonly rest! Causing those not yet converted to obtain conversion! those\nnot yet saved to be saved! those not yet at rest to find rest! those not\nyet enlightened to be enlightened!</p>\n<p>“Thus the Muni taught the way of rest for the direction of all living\nthings! alas! that any transgressing the way of holiness should practise\nimpure works. Even as at the end of the great kalpa, those holding the\nlaw who die, when the rolling sound of the mysterious thunder-cloud\nsevers the forests, upon these there shall fall the rain of immortality.\nThe little elephant breaks down the prickly forest, and by cherishing it\nwe know that it can profit men; but the cloud that removes the sorrow of\nthe elephant old-age, this none can bear. He by destroying systems of\nreligion has perfected his system, in saving the world and yet saving!\nhe has destroyed the teaching of heresy, in order to reach his\nindependent mode of doctrine.</p>\n<p>“And now he enters the great quiet place! no longer has the world a\nprotector or saviour! the great army host of Mâra-râga, rousing their\nwarrior, shaking the great earth, desired to injure the honored Muni:\nbut they could not move him, whom in a moment now the Mâra ‘inconstancy’\ndestroys. The heavenly occupants everywhere assemble as a cloud! they\nfill the space of heaven, fearing the endless birth and death! their\nhearts are full of grief and dread! His Deva eyes clearly behold,\nwithout the limitations of near or distant, the fruits of works\ndiscerned throughout, as an image perceived in a mirror! His Deva ears\nperfect and discriminating throughout, hear all, though far away,\nmounting through space he teaches all the Devas, surpassing his method\nof converting men! He divides his body still one in substance, crosses\nthe water as if it were not weak (to bear)! remembers all his former\nbirths, through countless kalpas none forgotten! His senses wandering\nthrough the fields of sense, all these distinctly remembered; knowing\nthe wisdom learned in every state of mind, all this perfectly\nunderstood! By spiritual discernment and pure mysterious wisdom equally\nsurveying all things! every vestige of imperfection removed! thus he has\naccomplished all he had to do. By wisdom rejecting other spheres of\nlife, his wisdom now completely perfected, lo! he dies! let the world,\nhard and unyielding, still, beholding it, relent!</p>\n<p>“All living things though blunt in sense, beholding him, receive the\nenlightenment of wisdom! their endless evil deeds long past, as they\nbehold, are cancelled and completely cleansed! In a moment gone! who\nshall again exhibit qualities like his? no saviour now in all the\nworld—our hope cut off, our very breath is stopped and gone! Who now\nshall give us life again with the cool water of his doctrine? his own\ngreat work accomplished, his great compassion now has ceased to work for\nlong: has long ceased or stopped! The world ensnared in the toils of\nfolly, who shall destroy the net? who shall, by his teaching, cause the\nstream of birth and death to turn again? Who shall declare the way of\nrest to instruct the heart of all that lives, deceived by ignorance? Who\nwill point out the quiet place, or who make known the one true doctrine?</p>\n<p>“All flesh suffering great sorrow, who shall deliver, like a loving\nfather? Like the horse changing his master loses all gracefulness, as he\nforgets his many words of guidance! as a king without a kingdom, such is\nthe world without a Buddha! as a disciple with no power of dialectic\nleft, or like a physician without wisdom, as men whose king has lost the\nmarks of royalty, so, Buddha dead, the world has lost its glory! the\ngentle horses left without a charioteer, the boat without a pilot left!\nThe three divisions of an army left without a general! the merchantman\nwithout a guide! the suffering and diseased without a physician! a holy\nking without his seven insignia. The stars without the moon! the loving\nyears without the power of life! such is the world now that Buddha, the\ngreat teacher, dies!”</p>\n<p>Thus spake the Arhat, all done that should be done, all imperfections\nquite removed, knowing the meed of gratitude, he was grateful therefore.\nThus thinking of his master’s love he spake! setting forth the world’s\ngreat sorrow; whilst those, not yet freed from the power of passion,\nwept with many tears, unable to control themselves. Yet even those who\nhad put away all faults, sighed as they thought of the pain of birth and\ndeath. And now the Malla host hearing that Buddha had attained Nirvâna,\nwith cries confused, wept piteously, greatly moved, as when a flight of\nherons meet a hawk. In a body now they reach the twin trees, and as they\ngaze upon Tathâgata dead, entered on his long sleep, those features\nnever again to awake to consciousness, they smote their breasts and\nsighed to heaven; as when a lion seizing on a calf, the whole herd\nrushes on with mingled sounds.</p>\n<p>In the midst there was one Malla, his mind enamoured of the righteous\nlaw, who gazed with steadfastness upon the holy law-king, now entered on\nthe mighty calm, and said: “The world was everywhere asleep, when Buddha\nsetting forth his law caused it to awake; but now he has entered on the\nmighty calm, and all is finished in an unending sleep. For man’s sake he\nhad raised the standard of his law, and now, in a moment, it has fallen;\nthe sun of Tathâgata’s wisdom spreading abroad the lustre of its ‘great\nawakening,’ increasing ever more and more in glory, spreading abroad the\nthousand rays of highest knowledge, scattering and destroying all the\ngloom of earth, why has the darkness great come back again? His\nunequalled wisdom lightening the three worlds, giving eyes that all the\nworld might see, now suddenly the world is blind again, bewildered,\nignorant of the way; in a moment fallen the bridge of truth that spanned\nthe rolling stream of birth and death, the swelling flood of lust and\nrage and doubt, and all flesh overwhelmed therein, forever lost.”</p>\n<p>Thus all that Malla host wept piteously and lamented; whilst some\nconcealed their grief nor spoke a word; others sank prostrate on the\nearth; others stood silent, lost in meditation; others, with sorrowful\nheart, groaned deeply. Then on a gold and silver gem-decked couch richly\nadorned with flowers and scents, they placed the body of Tathâgata; a\njewelled canopy they raised above, and round it flags and streamers and\nembroidered banners; then using every kind of dance and music, the lords\nand ladies of the Mallas followed along the road presenting offerings,\nwhilst all the Devas scattered scents and flowers, and raised the sound\nof drums and music in the heavens. Thus men and Devas shared one common\nsorrow, their cries united as they grieved together. Entering the city,\nthere the men and women, old and young, completed their religious\nofferings. Leaving the city, then, and passing through the Lung-tsiang\ngate, and crossing over the Hiranyavati river, they repaired to where\nthe former Buddhas, having died, had Kaityas raised to them. There\ncollecting ox-head sandal-wood and every famous scented wood, they\nplaced the whole above the Buddha’s body, pouring various scented oils\nupon the pyre; then placing fire beneath to kindle it, three times they\nwalked around; but yet it burned not. At this time the great Kâsyapa had\ntaken his abode at Râgagriha, and knowing Buddha was about to die was\ncoming thence with all his followers; his pure mind, deeply moved,\ndesired to see the body of the lord; and so, because of that his sincere\nwish, the fire went out and would not kindle. Then Kâsyapa and his\nfollowers coming, with piteous sighs looked on the sight and reverenced\nat the master’s feet; and then, forthwith, the fire burst out. Quenched\nthe fire of grief within; without, the fire has little power to burn. Or\nthough it burn the outside skin and flesh, the diamond true-bone still\nremains. The scented oil consumed, the fire declines, the bones they\nplace within a golden pitcher; for as the mystic world is not destroyed,\nneither can these, the bones of Buddha, perish; the consequence of\ndiamond wisdom, difficult to move as Sumeru. The relics which the mighty\ngolden-pinioned bird cannot remove or change, they place within the\nprecious vase, to remain until the world shall pass away; and wonderful!\nthe power of men can thus fulfil Nirvâna’s laws, the illustrious name of\none far spread, is sounded thus throughout the universe; and as the ages\nroll, the long Nirvâna, by these, the sacred relics, sheds through the\nworld its glorious light, and brightens up the abodes of life. He\nperished in a moment! but these relics, placed within the vase, the\nimperishable signs of wisdom, can overturn the mount of sorrow; the body\nof accumulated griefs this imperishable mind can cause to rest, and\nbanish once forever all the miseries of life. Thus the diamond substance\nwas dealt with at the place of burning. And now those valiant Mallas,\nunrivalled in the world for strength, subduing all private animosities,\nsought escape from sorrow in the true refuge. Finding sweet comfort in\nunited love, they resolved to banish every complaining thought.\nBeholding thus the death of Tathâgata, they controlled their grieving\nhearts, and with full strength of manly virtue dismissing every listless\nthought, they submitted to the course of nature. Oppressed by thoughts\nof grievous sorrow, they entered the city as a deserted wild: holding\nthe relics thus they entered, whilst from every street were offered\ngifts. They placed the relics then upon a tower for men and Devas to\nadore.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/division-of-the-sariras/\">Division of the Sariras</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At this time there was a Devaputra, riding on his thousand white-swan\npalace in the midst of space, who beheld the Parinirvâna of Buddha.

His\nunequalled wisdom lightening the three worlds, giving eyes that all the\nworld might see, now suddenly the world is blind again, bewildered,\nignorant of the way; in a moment fallen the bridge of truth that spanned\nthe rolling stream of birth and death, the swelling flood of lust and\nrage and doubt, and all flesh overwhelmed therein, forever lost.”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thus all that Malla host wept piteously and lamented; whilst some\nconcealed their grief nor spoke a word; others sank prostrate on the\nearth; others stood silent, lost in meditation; others, with sorrowful\nheart, groaned deeply. Then on a gold and silver gem-decked couch richly\nadorned with flowers and scents, they placed the body of Tathâgata; a\njewelled canopy they raised above, and round it flags and streamers and\nembroidered banners; then using every kind of dance and music, the lords\nand ladies of the Mallas followed along the road presenting offerings,\nwhilst all the Devas scattered scents and flowers, and raised the sound\nof drums and music in the heavens. Thus men and Devas shared one common\nsorrow, their cries united as they grieved together. Entering the city,\nthere the men and women, old and young, completed their religious\nofferings. Leaving the city, then, and passing through the Lung-tsiang\ngate, and crossing over the Hiranyavati river, they repaired to where\nthe former Buddhas, having died, had Kaityas raised to them. There\ncollecting ox-head sandal-wood and every famous scented wood, they\nplaced the whole above the Buddha’s body, pouring various scented oils\nupon the pyre; then placing fire beneath to kindle it, three times they\nwalked around; but yet it burned not. At this time the great Kâsyapa had\ntaken his abode at Râgagriha, and knowing Buddha was about to die was\ncoming thence with all his followers; his pure mind, deeply moved,\ndesired to see the body of the lord; and so, because of that his sincere\nwish, the fire went out and would not kindle. Then Kâsyapa and his\nfollowers coming, with piteous sighs looked on the sight and reverenced\nat the master’s feet; and then, forthwith, the fire burst out. Quenched\nthe fire of grief within; without, the fire has little power to burn. Or\nthough it burn the outside skin and flesh, the diamond true-bone still\nremains. The scented oil consumed, the fire declines, the bones they\nplace within a golden pitcher; for as the mystic world is not destroyed,\nneither can these, the bones of Buddha, perish; the consequence of\ndiamond wisdom, difficult to move as Sumeru. The relics which the mighty\ngolden-pinioned bird cannot remove or change, they place within the\nprecious vase, to remain until the world shall pass away; and wonderful!\nthe power of men can thus fulfil Nirvâna’s laws, the illustrious name of\none far spread, is sounded thus throughout the universe; and as the ages\nroll, the long Nirvâna, by these, the sacred relics, sheds through the\nworld its glorious light, and brightens up the abodes of life. He\nperished in a moment! but these relics, placed within the vase, the\nimperishable signs of wisdom, can overturn the mount of sorrow; the body\nof accumulated griefs this imperishable mind can cause to rest, and\nbanish once forever all the miseries of life. Thus the diamond substance\nwas dealt with at the place of burning. And now those valiant Mallas,\nunrivalled in the world for strength, subduing all private animosities,\nsought escape from sorrow in the true refuge. Finding sweet comfort in\nunited love, they resolved to banish every complaining thought.\nBeholding thus the death of Tathâgata, they controlled their grieving\nhearts, and with full strength of manly virtue dismissing every listless\nthought, they submitted to the course of nature. Oppressed by thoughts\nof grievous sorrow, they entered the city as a deserted wild: holding\nthe relics thus they entered, whilst from every street were offered\ngifts. They placed the relics then upon a tower for men and Devas to\nadore."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"style":"text-align:center"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/division-of-the-sariras/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Division of the Sariras"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"excerpt":"At this time there was a Devaputra, riding on his thousand white-swan\npalace in the midst of space, who beheld the Parinirvâna of Buddha…","timeToRead":11,"frontmatter":{"type":"text","title":"Life of Buddha","userDate":null,"date":null,"tags":null,"excerpt":"Praising Nirvâna","parentPath":null,"picture":null,"author":["Aśvaghoṣa"]}},"relatedPosts":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/praising-nirvana/","prev":{"excerpt":"And on such grounds it is that those who held\nThe stuff of things is fire, and out of fire\nAlone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen\nMightily…","timeToRead":11,"frontmatter":{"title":"On the Nature of Things","type":"text","hidden":true,"tags":null,"date":null,"draft":false,"excerpt":"BOOK I - CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS","author":["Titus Lucretius Carus"]},"fields":{"layout":"post","slug":"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/i/confutation-of-other-philosophers/"}},"next":{"excerpt":"At this time there was a great householder whose name was “Friend of the\nOrphaned and Destitute”; he was very rich and widely charitable in…","timeToRead":12,"frontmatter":{"title":"Life of Buddha","type":"text","hidden":true,"tags":null,"date":null,"draft":false,"excerpt":"Conversion of the \"Supporter of the Orphans and Destitute\"","author":["Aśvaghoṣa"]},"fields":{"layout":"post","slug":"/texts/life-of-buddha/iv/conversion-of-the-supporter-of-the-orphans-and-destitute/"}},"primaryTag":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614332127"]}
