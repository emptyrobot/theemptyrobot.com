I have fixed three months to end my life, the\nrest of life I utterly give up; this is the reason why the earth is\ngreatly shaken.”</p>\n<p>Ânanda, hearing the instruction of Buddha, was moved with pity and the\ntears flowed down his face, even as when an elephant of mighty strength\nshakes the sandal-wood tree. Thus was Ânanda shaken and his mind\nperturbed, whilst down his cheeks the tears, like drops of perfume,\nflowed; so much he loved the lord his master, so full of kindness was\nhe, and, as yet, not freed from earthly thoughts. Thinking then on these\nfour things alone, he gave his grief full liberty, nor could he master\nit, but said, “Now I hear the lord declare that he has fixed for good\nhis time to die, my body fails, my strength is gone, my mind is dazed,\nmy soul is all discordant, and all the words of truth forgotten; a wild\ndeserted waste seems heaven and earth. Have pity! save me, master!\nperish not so soon! Perished with bitter cold, I chanced upon a\nfire—forthwith it disappeared. Wandering amid the wilds of grief and\npain, deceived, confused, I lost my way—suddenly a wise and prudent\nguide encountered me, but hardly saved from my bewilderment, he once\nmore vanished. Like some poor man treading through endless mud, weary\nand parched with thirst, longs for the water, suddenly he lights upon a\ncool refreshing lake, he hastens to it—lo! it dries before him. The\ndeep blue, bright, refulgent eye, piercing through all the worlds, with\nwisdom brightens the dark gloom, the darkness for a moment is dispelled.\nAs when the blade shoots through the yielding earth, the clouds collect\nand we await the welcome shower, then a fierce wind drives the big\nclouds away, and so with disappointed hope we watch the dried-up field!\nDeep darkness reigned for want of wisdom, the world of sentient\ncreatures groped for light, Tathâgata lit up the lamp of wisdom, then\nsuddenly extinguished it—ere he had brought it out.”</p>\n<p>Buddha, hearing Ânanda speaking thus, grieved at his words, and pitying\nhis distress, with soothing accents and with gentle presence spake with\npurpose to declare the one true law:—</p>\n<p>“If men but knew their own nature, they would not dwell in sorrow;\neverything that lives, whate’er it be, all this is subject to\ndestruction’s law; I have already told you plainly, the law of things\n‘joined’ is to ‘separate’; the principle of kindness and of love is not\nabiding, ‘tis better then to reject this pitiful and doting heart. All\nthings around us bear the stamp of instant change; born, they perish; no\nself-sufficiency; those who would wish to keep them long, find in the\nend no room for doing so. If things around us could be kept for aye, and\nwere not liable to change or separation, then this would be salvation!\nwhere then can this be sought? You, and all that lives, can seek in me\nthis great deliverance! That which you may all attain I have already\ntold you, and tell you, to the end. Why then should I preserve this\nbody? The body of the excellent law shall long endure! I am resolved; I\nlook for rest! This is the one thing needful. So do I now instruct all\ncreatures, and as a guide, not seen before, I lead them; prepare\nyourselves to cast off consciousness, fix yourselves well in your own\nisland. Those who are thus fixed mid-stream, with single aim and\nearnestness striving in the use of means, preparing quietly a quiet\nplace, not moved by others’ way of thinking, know well, such men are\nsafe on the law’s island. Fixed in contemplation, lighted by the lamp of\nwisdom, they have thus finally destroyed ignorance and gloom. Consider\nwell the world’s four bounds, and dare to seek for true religion only;\nforget ‘yourself,’ and every ‘ground of self,’ the bones, the nerves,\nthe skin, the flesh, the mucus, the blood that flows through every vein;\nbehold these things as constantly impure, what joy then can there be in\nsuch a body? every sensation born from cause, like the bubble floating\non the water. The sorrow coming from the consciousness of birth and\ndeath and inconstancy, removes all thought of joy—the mind acquainted\nwith the law of production, stability, and destruction, recognizes how\nagain and once again things follow or succeed one another with no\nendurance. But thinking well about Nirvâna, the thought of endurance is\nforever dismissed; we see how the samskâras from causes have arisen, and\nhow these aggregates will again dissolve, all of them impermanent. The\nfoolish man conceives the idea of ‘self,’ the wise man sees there is no\nground on which to build the idea of ‘self,’ thus through the world he\nrightly looks and well concludes, all, therefore, is but evil; the\naggregate amassed by sorrow must perish in the end! if once confirmed in\nthis conviction, that man perceives the truth. This body, too, of Buddha\nnow existing soon will perish: the law is one and constant, and without\nexception.” Buddha having delivered this excellent sermon, appeased the\nheart of Ânanda.</p>\n<p>Then all the Likkhavis, hearing the report, with fear and apprehension\nassembled in a body; devoid of their usual ornaments, they hastened to\nthe place where Buddha was. Having saluted him according to custom, they\nstood on one side, wishing to ask him a question, but not being able to\nfind words. Buddha, knowing well their heart, by way of remedy, in the\nright use of means, spake thus:—</p>\n<p>“Now I perfectly understand that you have in your minds unusual\nthoughts, not referring to worldly matters, but wholly connected with\nsubjects of religion; and now you wish to hear from me, what may be\nknown respecting the report about my resolve to terminate my life, and\nmy purpose to put an end to the repetition of birth. Impermanence is the\nnature of all that exists, constant change and restlessness its\nconditions; unfixed, unprofitable, without the marks of long endurance.\nIn ancient days the Rishi kings, Vasishtha Rishi, Mândhâtri, the\nKakravartin monarchs, and the rest, these and all others like them, the\nformer conquerors, who lived with strength like Îsvara, these all have\nlong ago perished, not one remains till now; the sun and moon, Sakra\nhimself, and the great multitude of his attendants, will all, without\nexception, perish; there is not one that can for long endure; all the\nBuddhas of the past ages, numerous as the sands of the Ganges, by their\nwisdom enlightening the world, have all gone out as a lamp; all the\nBuddhas yet to come will also perish in the same way; why then should I\nalone be different? I too will pass into Nirvana; but as they prepared\nothers for salvation, so now should you press forward in the path;\nVaisâli may be glad indeed, if you should find the way of rest! The\nworld, in truth, is void of help, the ‘three worlds’ not enough for\njoy—stay then the course of sorrow, by engendering a heart without\ndesire. Give up for good the long and straggling way of life, press\nonward on the northern track, step by step advance along the upward\nroad, as the sun skirts along the western mountains.”</p>\n<p>At this time the Likkhavis, with saddened hearts, went back along the\nway; lifting their hands to heaven and sighing bitterly: “Alas! what\nsorrow this! His body like the pure gold mountain, the marks upon his\nperson so majestic, ere long and like a towering crag he falls; not to\nlive, then why not, ‘not to love’? The powers of birth and death,\nweakened awhile, the lord Tathâgata, himself the fount of wisdom\nappeared, and now to give it up and disappear! without a saviour now,\nwhat check to sorrow? The world long time endured in darkness, and men\nwere led by a false light along the way—when lo! the sun of wisdom\nrose; and now, again, it fades and dies—no warning given. Behold the\nwhirling waves of ignorance engulfing all the world! Why is the bridge\nor raft of wisdom in a moment cut away? The loving and the great\nphysician king came with remedies of wisdom, beyond all price, to heal\nthe hurts and pains of men—why suddenly goes he away? The excellent and\nheavenly flag of love adorned with wisdom’s blazonry, embroidered with\nthe diamond heart, the world not satisfied with gazing on it, the\nglorious flag of heavenly worship! Why in a moment is it snapped? Why\nsuch misfortune for the world, when from the tide of constant\nrevolutions a way of escape was opened—but now shut again! and there is\nno escape from weary sorrow! Tathâgata, possessed of fond and loving\nheart, now steels himself and goes away; he holds his heart so patient\nand so loving, and, like the Wai-ka-ni flower, with thoughts cast down,\nirresolute and tardy, he goes depressed along the road. Or like a man\nfresh from a loved one’s grave, the funeral past and the last farewell\ntaken, comes back with anxious look.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/life-of-buddha/v/Parinirvana/\">Parinirvâna</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The venerable Ânanda, seeing the earth shaking on every side, his heart\nwas tearful and his hair erect; he asked the cause thereof of Buddha."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Buddha replied: “Ânanda!
