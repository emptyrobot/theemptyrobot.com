From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-i/xii/\">XII. From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-i/xiii/\">XIII. In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-i/xiv/\">XIV. From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-i/xv/\">XV. In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these.

Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/ix/\">IX. Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/x/\">X. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/xi/\">XI. Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/xii/\">XII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/xiii/\">XIII. Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/xiv/\">XIV. A man’s soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-ii/xv/\">XV.

As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iii/xv/\">XV. Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iii/xvi/\">XVI. To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iii/xvii/\">XVII. To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and</a></p>\n<h2>Book IV</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iv/i/\">I.

Whatsoever doth happen in the world, doth happen justly, and so if</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iv/ix/\">IX. Conceit no such things, as he that wrongeth thee conceiveth,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-iv/x/\">X. These two rules, thou must have always in a readiness.

An angry countenance is much against nature, and it is oftentimes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-vii/xix/\">XIX. Whensoever any man doth trespass against other, presently consider</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-vii/xx/\">XX.

Thou must use thyself also to keep thy body fixed and steady;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-vii/xxxiii/\">XXXIII. The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler’s,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-vii/xxxiv/\">XXXIV. Thou must continually ponder and consider with thyself, what</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-vii/xxxv/\">XXXV.

Upon every action that thou art about, put this question to thyself;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/iii/\">III. Alexander, Caius, Pompeius; what are these to Diogenes, Heraclitus,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/iv/\">IV. What they have done, they will still do, although thou shouldst hang</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/v/\">V. That which the nature of the universe doth busy herself about, is;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/vi/\">VI. Every particular nature hath content, when in its own proper course</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/vii/\">VII. Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read. What then? Hast thou</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/viii/\">VIII. Forbear henceforth to complain of the trouble of a courtly life,</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/ix/\">IX. Repentance is an inward and self-reprehension for the neglect or</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/x/\">X. This, what is it in itself, and by itself, according to its proper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/xi/\">XI.

As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/meditations/book-viii/xiii/\">XIII.
