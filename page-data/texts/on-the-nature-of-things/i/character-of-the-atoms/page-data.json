Know,<br>\nThat which can hold a void of things within<br>\nCan be naught else than matter in union knit.<br>\nThus matter, consisting of a solid frame,<br>\nHath power to be eternal, though all else,<br>\nThough all creation, be dissolved away.<br>\nAgain, were naught of empty and inane,<br>\nThe world were then a solid; as, without<br>\nSome certain bodies to fill the places held,<br>\nThe world that is were but a vacant void.<br>\nAnd so, infallibly, alternate-wise<br>\nBody and void are still distinguished,<br>\nSince nature knows no wholly full nor void.<br>\nThere are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power<br>\nTo vary forever the empty and the full;<br>\nAnd these can nor be sundered from without<br>\nBy beats and blows, nor from within be torn<br>\nBy penetration, nor be overthrown<br>\nBy any assault soever through the world—<br>\nFor without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,<br>\nNor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,<br>\nNor can it take the damp, or seeping cold<br>\nOr piercing fire, those old destroyers three;<br>\nBut the more void within a thing, the more<br>\nEntirely it totters at their sure assault.<br>\nThus if first bodies be, as I have taught,<br>\nSolid, without a void, they must be then<br>\nEternal; and, if matter ne’er had been<br>\nEternal, long ere now had all things gone<br>\nBack into nothing utterly, and all<br>\nWe see around from nothing had been born—<br>\nBut since I taught above that naught can be<br>\nFrom naught created, nor the once begotten<br>\nTo naught be summoned back, these primal germs<br>\nMust have an immortality of frame.<br>\nAnd into these must each thing be resolved,<br>\nWhen comes its supreme hour, that thus there be<br>\nAt hand the stuff for plenishing the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So primal germs have solid singleness<br>\nNor otherwise could they have been conserved<br>\nThrough aeons and infinity of time<br>\nFor the replenishment of wasted worlds.<br>\nOnce more, if nature had given a scope for things<br>\nTo be forever broken more and more,<br>\nBy now the bodies of matter would have been<br>\nSo far reduced by breakings in old days<br>\nThat from them nothing could, at season fixed,<br>\nBe born, and arrive its prime and top of life.<br>\nFor, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made;<br>\nAnd so whate’er the long infinitude<br>\nOf days and all fore-passed time would now<br>\nBy this have broken and ruined and dissolved,<br>\nThat same could ne’er in all remaining time<br>\nBe builded up for plenishing the world.<br>\nBut mark: infallibly a fixed bound<br>\nRemaineth stablished ‘gainst their breaking down;<br>\nSince we behold each thing soever renewed,<br>\nAnd unto all, their seasons, after their kind,<br>\nWherein they arrive the flower of their age.</p>\n<p> Again, if bounds have not been set against<br>\nThe breaking down of this corporeal world,<br>\nYet must all bodies of whatever things<br>\nHave still endured from everlasting time<br>\nUnto this present, as not yet assailed<br>\nBy shocks of peril. But because the same<br>\nAre, to thy thinking, of a nature frail,<br>\nIt ill accords that thus they could remain<br>\n(As thus they do) through everlasting time,<br>\nVexed through the ages (as indeed they are)<br>\nBy the innumerable blows of chance.</p>\n<p>So in our programme of creation, mark<br>\nHow ‘tis that, though the bodies of all stuff<br>\nAre solid to the core, we yet explain<br>\nThe ways whereby some things are fashioned soft—<br>\nAir, water, earth, and fiery exhalations—<br>\nAnd by what force they function and go on:<br>\nThe fact is founded in the void of things.<br>\nBut if the primal germs themselves be soft,<br>\nReason cannot be brought to bear to show<br>\nThe ways whereby may be created these<br>\nGreat crags of basalt and the during iron;<br>\nFor their whole nature will profoundly lack<br>\nThe first foundations of a solid frame.<br>\nBut powerful in old simplicity,<br>\nAbide the solid, the primeval germs;<br>\nAnd by their combinations more condensed,<br>\nAll objects can be tightly knit and bound<br>\nAnd made to show unconquerable strength.<br>\nAgain, since all things kind by kind obtain<br>\nFixed bounds of growing and conserving life;<br>\nSince Nature hath inviolably decreed<br>\nWhat each can do, what each can never do;<br>\nSince naught is changed, but all things so abide<br>\nThat ever the variegated birds reveal<br>\nThe spots or stripes peculiar to their kind,<br>\nSpring after spring: thus surely all that is<br>\nMust be composed of matter immutable.<br>\nFor if the primal germs in any wise<br>\nWere open to conquest and to change, ‘twould be<br>\nUncertain also what could come to birth<br>\nAnd what could not, and by what law to each<br>\nIts scope prescribed, its boundary stone that clings<br>\nSo deep in Time. Nor could the generations<br>\nKind after kind so often reproduce<br>\nThe nature, habits, motions, ways of life,<br>\nOf their progenitors.</p>\n<p>                           And then again,<br>\nSince there is ever an extreme bounding point</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Of that first body which our senses now<br>\nCannot perceive: That bounding point indeed<br>\nExists without all parts, a minimum<br>\nOf nature, nor was e’er a thing apart,<br>\nAs of itself,—nor shall hereafter be,<br>\nSince ‘tis itself still parcel of another,<br>\nA first and single part, whence other parts<br>\nAnd others similar in order lie<br>\nIn a packed phalanx, filling to the full<br>\nThe nature of first body: being thus<br>\nNot self-existent, they must cleave to that<br>\nFrom which in nowise they can sundered be.<br>\nSo primal germs have solid singleness,<br>\nWhich tightly packed and closely joined cohere<br>\nBy virtue of their minim particles—<br>\nNo compound by mere union of the same;<br>\nBut strong in their eternal singleness,<br>\nNature, reserving them as seeds for things,<br>\nPermitteth naught of rupture or decrease.</p>\n<p>Moreover, were there not a minimum,<br>\nThe smallest bodies would have infinites,<br>\nSince then a half-of-half could still be halved,<br>\nWith limitless division less and less.<br>\nThen what the difference ‘twixt the sum and least?<br>\nNone: for however infinite the sum,<br>\nYet even the smallest would consist the same<br>\nOf infinite parts. But since true reason here<br>\nProtests, denying that the mind can think it,<br>\nConvinced thou must confess such things there are<br>\nAs have no parts, the minimums of nature.<br>\nAnd since these are, likewise confess thou must<br>\nThat primal bodies are solid and eterne.<br>\nAgain, if Nature, creatress of all things,<br>\nWere wont to force all things to be resolved<br>\nUnto least parts, then would she not avail<br>\nTo reproduce from out them anything;<br>\nBecause whate’er is not endowed with parts<br>\nCannot possess those properties required<br>\nOf generative stuff—divers connections,<br>\nWeights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things<br>\nForevermore have being and go on.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/i/confutation-of-other-philosophers/\">BOOK I - CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                     Bodies, again,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAre partly primal germs of things, and partly"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nUnions deriving from the primal germs."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd those which are the primal germs of things"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNo power can quench;
