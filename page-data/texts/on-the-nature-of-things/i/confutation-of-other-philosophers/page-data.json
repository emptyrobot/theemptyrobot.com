For dolts are ever prone<br>\nThat to bewonder and adore which hides<br>\nBeneath distorted words, holding that true<br>\nWhich sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,<br>\nOr which is rouged in finely finished phrase.<br>\nFor how, I ask, can things so varied be,<br>\nIf formed of fire, single and pure? No whit<br>\n‘Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,<br>\nIf all the parts of fire did still preserve<br>\nBut fire’s own nature, seen before in gross.<br>\nThe heat were keener with the parts compressed,<br>\nMilder, again, when severed or dispersed—<br>\nAnd more than this thou canst conceive of naught<br>\nThat from such causes could become; much less<br>\nMight earth’s variety of things be born<br>\nFrom any fires soever, dense or rare.<br>\nThis too: if they suppose a void in things,<br>\nThen fires can be condensed and still left rare;<br>\nBut since they see such opposites of thought<br>\nRising against them, and are loath to leave<br>\nAn unmixed void in things, they fear the steep<br>\nAnd lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,<br>\nThat, if from things we take away the void,<br>\nAll things are then condensed, and out of all<br>\nOne body made, which has no power to dart<br>\nSwiftly from out itself not anything—<br>\nAs throws the fire its light and warmth around,<br>\nGiving thee proof its parts are not compact.<br>\nBut if perhaps they think, in other wise,<br>\nFires through their combinations can be quenched<br>\nAnd change their substance, very well: behold,<br>\nIf fire shall spare to do so in no part,<br>\nThen heat will perish utterly and all,<br>\nAnd out of nothing would the world be formed.<br>\nFor change in anything from out its bounds<br>\nMeans instant death of that which was before;<br>\nAnd thus a somewhat must persist unharmed<br>\nAmid the world, lest all return to naught,<br>\nAnd, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.<br>\nNow since indeed there are those surest bodies<br>\nWhich keep their nature evermore the same,<br>\nUpon whose going out and coming in<br>\nAnd changed order things their nature change,<br>\nAnd all corporeal substances transformed,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,<br>\nAre not of fire. For ‘twere of no avail<br>\nShould some depart and go away, and some<br>\nBe added new, and some be changed in order,<br>\nIf still all kept their nature of old heat:<br>\nFor whatsoever they created then<br>\nWould still in any case be only fire.<br>\nThe truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are<br>\nWhose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes<br>\nProduce the fire and which, by order changed,<br>\nDo change the nature of the thing produced,<br>\nAnd are thereafter nothing like to fire<br>\nNor whatso else has power to send its bodies<br>\nWith impact touching on the senses’ touch.</p>\n<p>Again, to say that all things are but fire<br>\nAnd no true thing in number of all things<br>\nExists but fire, as this same fellow says,<br>\nSeems crazed folly. For the man himself<br>\nAgainst the senses by the senses fights,<br>\nAnd hews at that through which is all belief,<br>\nThrough which indeed unto himself is known<br>\nThe thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks<br>\nThe senses truly can perceive the fire,<br>\nHe thinks they cannot as regards all else,<br>\nWhich still are palpably as clear to sense—<br>\nTo me a thought inept and crazy too.<br>\nFor whither shall we make appeal? for what<br>\nMore certain than our senses can there be<br>\nWhereby to mark asunder error and truth?<br>\nBesides, why rather do away with all,<br>\nAnd wish to allow heat only, then deny<br>\nThe fire and still allow all else to be?—<br>\nAlike the madness either way it seems.<br>\nThus whosoe’er have held the stuff of things<br>\nTo be but fire, and out of fire the sum,<br>\nAnd whosoever have constituted air<br>\nAs first beginning of begotten things,<br>\nAnd all whoever have held that of itself<br>\nWater alone contrives things, or that earth<br>\nCreateth all and changes things anew<br>\nTo divers natures, mightily they seem<br>\nA long way to have wandered from the truth.</p>\n<p>Add, too, whoever make the primal stuff<br>\nTwofold, by joining air to fire, and earth<br>\nTo water; add who deem that things can grow<br>\nOut of the four—fire, earth, and breath, and rain;<br>\nAs first Empedocles of Acragas,<br>\nWhom that three-cornered isle of all the lands<br>\nBore on her coasts, around which flows and flows<br>\nIn mighty bend and bay the Ionic seas,<br>\nSplashing the brine from off their gray-green waves.<br>\nHere, billowing onward through the narrow straits,<br>\nSwift ocean cuts her boundaries from the shores<br>\nOf the Italic mainland. Here the waste<br>\nCharybdis; and here Aetna rumbles threats<br>\nTo gather anew such furies of its flames<br>\nAs with its force anew to vomit fires,<br>\nBelched from its throat, and skyward bear anew<br>\nIts lightnings’ flash. And though for much she seem<br>\nThe mighty and the wondrous isle to men,<br>\nMost rich in all good things, and fortified<br>\nWith generous strength of heroes, she hath ne’er<br>\nPossessed within her aught of more renown,<br>\nNor aught more holy, wonderful, and dear<br>\nThan this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure<br>\nThe lofty music of his breast divine<br>\nLifts up its voice and tells of glories found,<br>\nThat scarce he seems of human stock create.</p>\n<p>Yet he and those forementioned (known to be<br>\nSo far beneath him, less than he in all),<br>\nThough, as discoverers of much goodly truth,<br>\nThey gave, as ‘twere from out of the heart’s own shrine,<br>\nResponses holier and soundlier based<br>\nThan ever the Pythia pronounced for men<br>\nFrom out the triped and the Delphian laurel,<br>\nHave still in matter of first-elements<br>\nMade ruin of themselves, and, great men, great<br>\nIndeed and heavy there for them the fall:<br>\nFirst, because, banishing the void from things,<br>\nThey yet assign them motion, and allow<br>\nThings soft and loosely textured to exist,<br>\nAs air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains,<br>\nWithout admixture of void amid their frame.<br>\nNext, because, thinking there can be no end<br>\nIn cutting bodies down to less and less<br>\nNor pause established to their breaking up,<br>\nThey hold there is no minimum in things;<br>\nAlbeit we see the boundary point of aught<br>\nIs that which to our senses seems its least,<br>\nWhereby thou mayst conjecture, that, because<br>\nThe things thou canst not mark have boundary points,<br>\nThey surely have their minimums. Then, too,<br>\nSince these philosophers ascribe to things<br>\nSoft primal germs, which we behold to be<br>\nOf birth and body mortal, thus, throughout,<br>\nThe sum of things must be returned to naught,<br>\nAnd, born from naught, abundance thrive anew—<br>\nThou seest how far each doctrine stands from truth.<br>\nAnd, next, these bodies are among themselves<br>\nIn many ways poisons and foes to each,<br>\nWherefore their congress will destroy them quite<br>\nOr drive asunder as we see in storms<br>\nRains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly.</p>\n<p>Thus too, if all things are create of four,<br>\nAnd all again dissolved into the four,<br>\nHow can the four be called the primal germs<br>\nOf things, more than all things themselves be thought,<br>\nBy retroversion, primal germs of them?<br>\nFor ever alternately are both begot,<br>\nWith interchange of nature and aspect<br>\nFrom immemorial time. But if percase<br>\nThou think’st the frame of fire and earth, the air,<br>\nThe dew of water can in such wise meet<br>\nAs not by mingling to resign their nature,<br>\nFrom them for thee no world can be create—<br>\nNo thing of breath, no stock or stalk of tree:<br>\nIn the wild congress of this varied heap<br>\nEach thing its proper nature will display,<br>\nAnd air will palpably be seen mixed up<br>\nWith earth together, unquenched heat with water.<br>\nBut primal germs in bringing things to birth<br>\nMust have a latent, unseen quality,<br>\nLest some outstanding alien element<br>\nConfuse and minish in the thing create<br>\nIts proper being.</p>\n<p>                  But these men begin<br>\nFrom heaven, and from its fires; and first they feign<br>\nThat fire will turn into the winds of air,<br>\nNext, that from air the rain begotten is,<br>\nAnd earth created out of rain, and then<br>\nThat all, reversely, are returned from earth—<br>\nThe moisture first, then air thereafter heat—<br>\nAnd that these same ne’er cease in interchange,<br>\nTo go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth<br>\nUnto the stars of the aethereal world—<br>\nWhich in no wise at all the germs can do.<br>\nSince an immutable somewhat still must be,<br>\nLest all things utterly be sped to naught;<br>\nFor change in anything from out its bounds<br>\nMeans instant death of that which was before.<br>\nWherefore, since those things, mentioned heretofore,<br>\nSuffer a changed state, they must derive<br>\nFrom others ever unconvertible,<br>\nLest an things utterly return to naught.<br>\nThen why not rather presuppose there be<br>\nBodies with such a nature furnished forth<br>\nThat, if perchance they have created fire,<br>\nCan still (by virtue of a few withdrawn,<br>\nOr added few, and motion and order changed)<br>\nFashion the winds of air, and thus all things<br>\nForevermore be interchanged with all?</p>\n<p>“But facts in proof are manifest,” thou sayest,<br>\n“That all things grow into the winds of air<br>\nAnd forth from earth are nourished, and unless<br>\nThe season favour at propitious hour<br>\nWith rains enough to set the trees a-reel<br>\nUnder the soak of bulking thunderheads,<br>\nAnd sun, for its share, foster and give heat,<br>\nNo grains, nor trees, nor breathing things can grow.”<br>\nTrue—and unless hard food and moisture soft<br>\nRecruited man, his frame would waste away,<br>\nAnd life dissolve from out his thews and bones;<br>\nFor out of doubt recruited and fed are we<br>\nBy certain things, as other things by others.<br>\nBecause in many ways the many germs<br>\nCommon to many things are mixed in things,<br>\nNo wonder ‘tis that therefore divers things<br>\nBy divers things are nourished. And, again,<br>\nOften it matters vastly with what others,<br>\nIn what positions the primordial germs<br>\nAre bound together, and what motions, too,<br>\nThey give and get among themselves; for these<br>\nSame germs do put together sky, sea, lands,<br>\nRivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,<br>\nBut yet commixed they are in divers modes<br>\nWith divers things, forever as they move.<br>\nNay, thou beholdest in our verses here<br>\nElements many, common to many worlds,<br>\nAlbeit thou must confess each verse, each word<br>\nFrom one another differs both in sense<br>\nAnd ring of sound—so much the elements<br>\nCan bring about by change of order alone.<br>\nBut those which are the primal germs of things<br>\nHave power to work more combinations still,<br>\nWhence divers things can be produced in turn.</p>\n<p>Now let us also take for scrutiny<br>\nThe homeomeria of Anaxagoras,<br>\nSo called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech<br>\nYieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,<br>\nAlthough the thing itself is not o’erhard<br>\nFor explanation. First, then, when he speaks<br>\nOf this homeomeria of things, he thinks<br>\nBones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,<br>\nAnd from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,<br>\nAnd blood created out of drops of blood,<br>\nConceiving gold compact of grains of gold,<br>\nAnd earth concreted out of bits of earth,<br>\nFire made of fires, and water out of waters,<br>\nFeigning the like with all the rest of stuff.<br>\nYet he concedes not any void in things,<br>\nNor any limit to cutting bodies down.<br>\nWherefore to me he seems on both accounts<br>\nTo err no less than those we named before.<br>\nAdd too: these germs he feigns are far too frail—<br>\nIf they be germs primordial furnished forth<br>\nWith but same nature as the things themselves,<br>\nAnd travail and perish equally with those,<br>\nAnd no rein curbs them from annihilation.<br>\nFor which will last against the grip and crush<br>\nUnder the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?<br>\nOr else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?<br>\nNo one, methinks, when every thing will be<br>\nAt bottom as mortal as whate’er we mark<br>\nTo perish by force before our gazing eyes.<br>\nBut my appeal is to the proofs above<br>\nThat things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet<br>\nFrom naught increase. And now again, since food<br>\nAugments and nourishes the human frame,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones<br>\nAnd thews are formed of particles unlike<br>\nTo them in kind; or if they say all foods<br>\nAre of mixed substance having in themselves<br>\nSmall bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins<br>\nAnd particles of blood, then every food,<br>\nSolid or liquid, must itself be thought<br>\nAs made and mixed of things unlike in kind—<br>\nOf bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.<br>\nAgain, if all the bodies which upgrow<br>\nFrom earth, are first within the earth, then earth<br>\nMust be compound of alien substances.<br>\nWhich spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.<br>\nTransfer the argument, and thou may’st use<br>\nThe selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash<br>\nStill lurk unseen within the wood, the wood<br>\nMust be compound of alien substances<br>\nWhich spring from out the wood.</p>\n<p>                         Right here remains<br>\nA certain slender means to skulk from truth,<br>\nWhich Anaxagoras takes unto himself,<br>\nWho holds that all things lurk commixed with all<br>\nWhile that one only comes to view, of which<br>\nThe bodies exceed in number all the rest,<br>\nAnd lie more close to hand and at the fore—<br>\nA notion banished from true reason far.<br>\nFor then ‘twere meet that kernels of the grains<br>\nShould oft, when crunched between the might of stones,<br>\nGive forth a sign of blood, or of aught else<br>\nWhich in our human frame is fed; and that<br>\nRock rubbed on rock should yield a gory ooze.<br>\nLikewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops<br>\nOf sweet milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep’s;<br>\nIndeed we ought to find, when crumbling up<br>\nThe earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves,<br>\nAll sorts dispersed minutely in the soil;<br>\nLastly we ought to find in cloven wood<br>\nAshes and smoke and bits of fire there hid.<br>\nBut since fact teaches this is not the case,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things<br>\nThuswise; but seeds, common to many things,<br>\nCommixed in many ways, must lurk in things.</p>\n<p>“But often it happens on skiey hills” thou sayest,<br>\n“That neighbouring tops of lofty trees are rubbed<br>\nOne against other, smote by the blustering south,<br>\nTill all ablaze with bursting flower of flame.”<br>\nGood sooth—yet fire is not ingraft in wood,<br>\nBut many are the seeds of heat, and when<br>\nRubbing together they together flow,<br>\nThey start the conflagrations in the forests.<br>\nWhereas if flame, already fashioned, lay<br>\nStored up within the forests, then the fires<br>\nCould not for any time be kept unseen,<br>\nBut would be laying all the wildwood waste<br>\nAnd burning all the boscage. Now dost see<br>\n(Even as we said a little space above)<br>\nHow mightily it matters with what others,<br>\nIn what positions these same primal germs<br>\nAre bound together? And what motions, too,<br>\nThey give and get among themselves? how, hence,<br>\nThe same, if altered ‘mongst themselves, can body<br>\nBoth igneous and ligneous objects forth—<br>\nPrecisely as these words themselves are made<br>\nBy somewhat altering their elements,<br>\nAlthough we mark with name indeed distinct<br>\nThe igneous from the ligneous. Once again,<br>\nIf thou suppose whatever thou beholdest,<br>\nAmong all visible objects, cannot be,<br>\nUnless thou feign bodies of matter endowed<br>\nWith a like nature,—by thy vain device<br>\nFor thee will perish all the germs of things:<br>\n‘Twill come to pass they’ll laugh aloud, like men,<br>\nShaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,<br>\nOr moisten with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/i/the-infinity-of-the-universe/\">BOOK I - THE INFINITY OF THE UNIVERSE</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And on such grounds it is that those who held"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe stuff of things is fire, and out of fire"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAlone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMightily from true reason to have lapsed."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf whom, chief leader to do battle, comes"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThat Heraclitus, famous for dark speech"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAmong the silly, not the serious Greeks"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWho search for truth.
