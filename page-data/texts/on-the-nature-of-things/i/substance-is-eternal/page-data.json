Men from the sea<br>\nMight rise, and from the land the scaly breed,<br>\nAnd, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;<br>\nThe horned cattle, the herds and all the wild<br>\nWould haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;<br>\nNor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,<br>\nBut each might grow from any stock or limb<br>\nBy chance and change. Indeed, and were there not<br>\nFor each its procreant atoms, could things have<br>\nEach its unalterable mother old?<br>\nBut, since produced from fixed seeds are all,<br>\nEach birth goes forth upon the shores of light<br>\nFrom its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.<br>\nAnd all from all cannot become, because<br>\nIn each resides a secret power its own.<br>\nAgain, why see we lavished o’er the lands<br>\nAt spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,<br>\nThe vines that mellow when the autumn lures,<br>\nIf not because the fixed seeds of things<br>\nAt their own season must together stream,<br>\nAnd new creations only be revealed<br>\nWhen the due times arrive and pregnant earth<br>\nSafely may give unto the shores of light<br>\nHer tender progenies? But if from naught<br>\nWere their becoming, they would spring abroad<br>\nSuddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,<br>\nWith no primordial germs, to be preserved<br>\nFrom procreant unions at an adverse hour.<br>\nNor on the mingling of the living seeds<br>\nWould space be needed for the growth of things<br>\nWere life an increment of nothing: then<br>\nThe tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,<br>\nAnd from the turf would leap a branching tree—<br>\nWonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each<br>\nSlowly increases from its lawful seed,<br>\nAnd through that increase shall conserve its kind.<br>\nWhence take the proof that things enlarge and feed<br>\nFrom out their proper matter. Thus it comes<br>\nThat earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,<br>\nCould bear no produce such as makes us glad,<br>\nAnd whatsoever lives, if shut from food,<br>\nProlongs its kind and guards its life no more.<br>\nThus easier ‘tis to hold that many things<br>\nHave primal bodies in common (as we see<br>\nThe single letters common to many words)<br>\nThan aught exists without its origins.<br>\nMoreover, why should Nature not prepare<br>\nMen of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,<br>\nOr rend the mighty mountains with their hands,<br>\nOr conquer Time with length of days, if not<br>\nBecause for all begotten things abides<br>\nThe changeless stuff, and what from that may spring<br>\nIs fixed forevermore? Lastly we see<br>\nHow far the tilled surpass the fields untilled<br>\nAnd to the labour of our hands return<br>\nTheir more abounding crops; there are indeed<br>\nWithin the earth primordial germs of things,<br>\nWhich, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods<br>\nAnd kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.<br>\nElse would ye mark, without all toil of ours,<br>\nSpontaneous generations, fairer forms.<br>\nConfess then, naught from nothing can become,<br>\nSince all must have their seeds, wherefrom to grow,<br>\nWherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.<br>\nHence too it comes that Nature all dissolves<br>\nInto their primal bodies again, and naught<br>\nPerishes ever to annihilation.<br>\nFor, were aught mortal in its every part,<br>\nBefore our eyes it might be snatched away<br>\nUnto destruction; since no force were needed<br>\nTo sunder its members and undo its bands.<br>\nWhereas, of truth, because all things exist,<br>\nWith seed imperishable, Nature allows<br>\nDestruction nor collapse of aught, until<br>\nSome outward force may shatter by a blow,<br>\nOr inward craft, entering its hollow cells,<br>\nDissolve it down. And more than this, if Time,<br>\nThat wastes with eld the works along the world,<br>\nDestroy entire, consuming matter all,<br>\nWhence then may Venus back to light of life<br>\nRestore the generations kind by kind?<br>\nOr how, when thus restored, may daedal Earth<br>\nFoster and plenish with her ancient food,<br>\nWhich, kind by kind, she offers unto each?<br>\nWhence may the water-springs, beneath the sea,<br>\nOr inland rivers, far and wide away,<br>\nKeep the unfathomable ocean full?<br>\nAnd out of what does Ether feed the stars?<br>\nFor lapsed years and infinite age must else<br>\nHave eat all shapes of mortal stock away:<br>\nBut be it the Long Ago contained those germs,<br>\nBy which this sum of things recruited lives,<br>\nThose same infallibly can never die,<br>\nNor nothing to nothing evermore return.<br>\nAnd, too, the selfsame power might end alike<br>\nAll things, were they not still together held<br>\nBy matter eternal, shackled through its parts,<br>\nNow more, now less. A touch might be enough<br>\nTo cause destruction. For the slightest force<br>\nWould loose the weft of things wherein no part<br>\nWere of imperishable stock. But now<br>\nBecause the fastenings of primordial parts<br>\nAre put together diversely and stuff<br>\nIs everlasting, things abide the same<br>\nUnhurt and sure, until some power comes on<br>\nStrong to destroy the warp and woof of each:<br>\nNothing returns to naught; but all return<br>\nAt their collapse to primal forms of stuff.<br>\nLo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws<br>\nDown to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then<br>\nUpsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green<br>\nAmid the trees, and trees themselves wax big<br>\nAnd lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn<br>\nThe race of man and all the wild are fed;<br>\nHence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls;<br>\nAnd leafy woodlands echo with new birds;<br>\nHence cattle, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk<br>\nAlong the joyous pastures whilst the drops<br>\nOf white ooze trickle from distended bags;<br>\nHence the young scamper on their weakling joints<br>\nAlong the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk<br>\nWith warm new milk. Thus naught of what so seems<br>\nPerishes utterly, since Nature ever<br>\nUpbuilds one thing from other, suffering naught<br>\nTo come to birth but through some other’s death.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And now, since I have taught that things cannot<br>\nBe born from nothing, nor the same, when born,<br>\nTo nothing be recalled, doubt not my words,<br>\nBecause our eyes no primal germs perceive;<br>\nFor mark those bodies which, though known to be<br>\nIn this our world, are yet invisible:<br>\nThe winds infuriate lash our face and frame,<br>\nUnseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,<br>\nOr, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains<br>\nWith mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops<br>\nWith forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave<br>\nWith uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,<br>\n‘Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through<br>\nThe sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky,<br>\nVexing and whirling and seizing all amain;<br>\nAnd forth they flow and pile destruction round,<br>\nEven as the water’s soft and supple bulk<br>\nBecoming a river of abounding floods,<br>\nWhich a wide downpour from the lofty hills<br>\nSwells with big showers, dashes headlong down<br>\nFragments of woodland and whole branching trees;<br>\nNor can the solid bridges bide the shock<br>\nAs on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,<br>\nStrong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,<br>\nCrashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves<br>\nDown-toppled masonry and ponderous stone,<br>\nHurling away whatever would oppose.<br>\nEven so must move the blasts of all the winds,<br>\nWhich, when they spread, like to a mighty flood,<br>\nHither or thither, drive things on before<br>\nAnd hurl to ground with still renewed assault,<br>\nOr sometimes in their circling vortex seize<br>\nAnd bear in cones of whirlwind down the world:<br>\nThe winds are sightless bodies and naught else—<br>\nSince both in works and ways they rival well<br>\nThe mighty rivers, the visible in form.<br>\nThen too we know the varied smells of things<br>\nYet never to our nostrils see them come;<br>\nWith eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,<br>\nNor are we wont men’s voices to behold.<br>\nYet these must be corporeal at the base,<br>\nSince thus they smite the senses: naught there is<br>\nSave body, having property of touch.<br>\nAnd raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,<br>\nThe same, spread out before the sun, will dry;<br>\nYet no one saw how sank the moisture in,<br>\nNor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,<br>\nThat moisture is dispersed about in bits<br>\nToo small for eyes to see. Another case:<br>\nA ring upon the finger thins away<br>\nAlong the under side, with years and suns;<br>\nThe drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;<br>\nThe hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes<br>\nAmid the fields insidiously. We view<br>\nThe rock-paved highways worn by many feet;<br>\nAnd at the gates the brazen statues show<br>\nTheir right hands leaner from the frequent touch<br>\nOf wayfarers innumerable who greet.<br>\nWe see how wearing-down hath minished these,<br>\nBut just what motes depart at any time,<br>\nThe envious nature of vision bars our sight.<br>\nLastly whatever days and nature add<br>\nLittle by little, constraining things to grow<br>\nIn due proportion, no gaze however keen<br>\nOf these our eyes hath watched and known. No more<br>\nCan we observe what’s lost at any time,<br>\nWhen things wax old with eld and foul decay,<br>\nOr when salt seas eat under beetling crags.<br>\nThus Nature ever by unseen bodies works.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/i/the-void/\">BOOK I - THE VOID</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNot sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBut only Nature’s aspect and her law,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhich, teaching us, hath this exordium:"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNothing from nothing ever yet was born."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFear holds dominion over mortality"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOnly because, seeing in land and sky"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSo much the cause whereof no wise they know,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMen think Divinities are working there."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMeantime, when once we know from nothing still"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNothing can be create, we shall divine"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMore clearly what we seek: those elements"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom which alone all things created are,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd how accomplished by no tool of Gods."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSuppose all sprang from all things: any kind"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMight take its origin from any thing,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNo fixed seed required.
