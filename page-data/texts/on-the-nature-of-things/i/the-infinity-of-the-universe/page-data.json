I joy<br>\nTo come on undefiled fountains there,<br>\nTo drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,<br>\nTo seek for this my head a signal crown<br>\nFrom regions where the Muses never yet<br>\nHave garlanded the temples of a man:<br>\nFirst, since I teach concerning mighty things,<br>\nAnd go right on to loose from round the mind<br>\nThe tightened coils of dread religion;<br>\nNext, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame<br>\nSongs so pellucid, touching all throughout<br>\nEven with the Muses’ charm—which, as ‘twould seem,<br>\nIs not without a reasonable ground:<br>\nBut as physicians, when they seek to give<br>\nYoung boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch<br>\nThe brim around the cup with the sweet juice<br>\nAnd yellow of the honey, in order that<br>\nThe thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled<br>\nAs far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down<br>\nThe wormwood’s bitter draught, and, though befooled,<br>\nBe yet not merely duped, but rather thus<br>\nGrow strong again with recreated health:<br>\nSo now I too (since this my doctrine seems<br>\nIn general somewhat woeful unto those<br>\nWho’ve had it not in hand, and since the crowd<br>\nStarts back from it in horror) have desired<br>\nTo expound our doctrine unto thee in song<br>\nSoft-speaking and Pierian, and, as ‘twere,<br>\nTo touch it with sweet honey of the Muse—<br>\nIf by such method haply I might hold<br>\nThe mind of thee upon these lines of ours,<br>\nTill thou see through the nature of all things,<br>\nAnd how exists the interwoven frame.</p>\n<p>But since I’ve taught that bodies of matter, made<br>\nCompletely solid, hither and thither fly<br>\nForevermore unconquered through all time,<br>\nNow come, and whether to the sum of them<br>\nThere be a limit or be none, for thee<br>\nLet us unfold; likewise what has been found<br>\nTo be the wide inane, or room, or space<br>\nWherein all things soever do go on,<br>\nLet us examine if it finite be<br>\nAll and entire, or reach unmeasured round<br>\nAnd downward an illimitable profound.</p>\n<p>Thus, then, the All that is is limited<br>\nIn no one region of its onward paths,<br>\nFor then ‘tmust have forever its beyond.<br>\nAnd a beyond ‘tis seen can never be<br>\nFor aught, unless still further on there be<br>\nA somewhat somewhere that may bound the same—<br>\nSo that the thing be seen still on to where<br>\nThe nature of sensation of that thing<br>\nCan follow it no longer. Now because<br>\nConfess we must there’s naught beside the sum,<br>\nThere’s no beyond, and so it lacks all end.<br>\nIt matters nothing where thou post thyself,<br>\nIn whatsoever regions of the same;<br>\nEven any place a man has set him down<br>\nStill leaves about him the unbounded all<br>\nOutward in all directions; or, supposing<br>\nA moment the all of space finite to be,<br>\nIf some one farthest traveller runs forth<br>\nUnto the extreme coasts and throws ahead<br>\nA flying spear, is’t then thy wish to think<br>\nIt goes, hurled off amain, to where ‘twas sent<br>\nAnd shoots afar, or that some object there<br>\nCan thwart and stop it? For the one or other<br>\nThou must admit and take. Either of which<br>\nShuts off escape for thee, and does compel<br>\nThat thou concede the all spreads everywhere,<br>\nOwning no confines. Since whether there be<br>\nAught that may block and check it so it comes<br>\nNot where ‘twas sent, nor lodges in its goal,<br>\nOr whether borne along, in either view<br>\n‘Thas started not from any end. And so<br>\nI’ll follow on, and whereso’er thou set<br>\nThe extreme coasts, I’ll query, “what becomes<br>\nThereafter of thy spear?” ‘Twill come to pass<br>\nThat nowhere can a world’s-end be, and that<br>\nThe chance for further flight prolongs forever<br>\nThe flight itself. Besides, were all the space<br>\nOf the totality and sum shut in<br>\nWith fixed coasts, and bounded everywhere,<br>\nThen would the abundance of world’s matter flow<br>\nTogether by solid weight from everywhere<br>\nStill downward to the bottom of the world,<br>\nNor aught could happen under cope of sky,<br>\nNor could there be a sky at all or sun—<br>\nIndeed, where matter all one heap would lie,<br>\nBy having settled during infinite time.<br>\nBut in reality, repose is given<br>\nUnto no bodies ‘mongst the elements,<br>\nBecause there is no bottom whereunto<br>\nThey might, as ‘twere, together flow, and where<br>\nThey might take up their undisturbed abodes.<br>\nIn endless motion everything goes on<br>\nForevermore; out of all regions, even<br>\nOut of the pit below, from forth the vast,<br>\nAre hurtled bodies evermore supplied.<br>\nThe nature of room, the space of the abyss<br>\nIs such that even the flashing thunderbolts<br>\nCan neither speed upon their courses through,<br>\nGliding across eternal tracts of time,<br>\nNor, further, bring to pass, as on they run,<br>\nThat they may bate their journeying one whit:<br>\nSuch huge abundance spreads for things around—<br>\nRoom off to every quarter, without end.<br>\nLastly, before our very eyes is seen<br>\nThing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill,<br>\nAnd mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea,<br>\nAnd sea in turn all lands; but for the All<br>\nTruly is nothing which outside may bound.<br>\nThat, too, the sum of things itself may not<br>\nHave power to fix a measure of its own,<br>\nGreat nature guards, she who compels the void<br>\nTo bound all body, as body all the void,<br>\nThus rendering by these alternates the whole<br>\nAn infinite; or else the one or other,<br>\nBeing unbounded by the other, spreads,<br>\nEven by its single nature, ne’ertheless<br>\nImmeasurably forth…<br>\nNor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,<br>\nNor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods<br>\nCould keep their place least portion of an hour:<br>\nFor, driven apart from out its meetings fit,<br>\nThe stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne<br>\nAlong the illimitable inane afar,<br>\nOr rather, in fact, would ne’er have once combined<br>\nAnd given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,<br>\nIt could not be united. For of truth<br>\nNeither by counsel did the primal germs<br>\n‘Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,<br>\nEach in its proper place; nor did they make,<br>\nForsooth, a compact how each germ should move;<br>\nBut since, being many and changed in many modes<br>\nAlong the All, they’re driven abroad and vexed<br>\nBy blow on blow, even from all time of old,<br>\nThey thus at last, after attempting all<br>\nThe kinds of motion and conjoining, come<br>\nInto those great arrangements out of which<br>\nThis sum of things established is create,<br>\nBy which, moreover, through the mighty years,<br>\nIt is preserved, when once it has been thrown<br>\nInto the proper motions, bringing to pass<br>\nThat ever the streams refresh the greedy main<br>\nWith river-waves abounding, and that earth,<br>\nLapped in warm exhalations of the sun,<br>\nRenews her broods, and that the lusty race<br>\nOf breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that<br>\nThe gliding fires of ether are alive—<br>\nWhat still the primal germs nowise could do,<br>\nUnless from out the infinite of space<br>\nCould come supply of matter, whence in season<br>\nThey’re wont whatever losses to repair.<br>\nFor as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,<br>\nLosing its body, when deprived of food:<br>\nSo all things have to be dissolved as soon<br>\nAs matter, diverted by what means soever<br>\nFrom off its course, shall fail to be on hand.<br>\nNor can the blows from outward still conserve,<br>\nOn every side, whatever sum of a world<br>\nHas been united in a whole. They can<br>\nIndeed, by frequent beating, check a part,<br>\nTill others arriving may fulfil the sum;<br>\nBut meanwhile often are they forced to spring<br>\nRebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,<br>\nUnto those elements whence a world derives,<br>\nRoom and a time for flight, permitting them<br>\nTo be from off the massy union borne<br>\nFree and afar. Wherefore, again, again:<br>\nNeeds must there come a many for supply;<br>\nAnd also, that the blows themselves shall be<br>\nUnfailing ever, must there ever be<br>\nAn infinite force of matter all sides round.</p>\n<p>And in these problems, shrink, my Memmius, far<br>\nFrom yielding faith to that notorious talk:<br>\nThat all things inward to the centre press;<br>\nAnd thus the nature of the world stands firm<br>\nWith never blows from outward, nor can be<br>\nNowhere disparted—since all height and depth<br>\nHave always inward to the centre pressed<br>\n(If thou art ready to believe that aught<br>\nItself can rest upon itself ); or that<br>\nThe ponderous bodies which be under earth<br>\nDo all press upwards and do come to rest<br>\nUpon the earth, in some way upside down,<br>\nLike to those images of things we see<br>\nAt present through the waters. They contend,<br>\nWith like procedure, that all breathing things<br>\nHead downward roam about, and yet cannot<br>\nTumble from earth to realms of sky below,<br>\nNo more than these our bodies wing away<br>\nSpontaneously to vaults of sky above;<br>\nThat, when those creatures look upon the sun,<br>\nWe view the constellations of the night;<br>\nAnd that with us the seasons of the sky<br>\nThey thus alternately divide, and thus<br>\nDo pass the night coequal to our days,<br>\nBut a vain error has given these dreams to fools,<br>\nWhich they’ve embraced with reasoning perverse<br>\nFor centre none can be where world is still<br>\nBoundless, nor yet, if now a centre were,<br>\nCould aught take there a fixed position more<br>\nThan for some other cause ‘tmight be dislodged.<br>\nFor all of room and space we call the void<br>\nMust both through centre and non-centre yield<br>\nAlike to weights where’er their motions tend.<br>\nNor is there any place, where, when they’ve come,<br>\nBodies can be at standstill in the void,<br>\nDeprived of force of weight; nor yet may void<br>\nFurnish support to any,—nay, it must,<br>\nTrue to its bent of nature, still give way.<br>\nThus in such manner not at all can things<br>\nBe held in union, as if overcome<br>\nBy craving for a centre.</p>\n<p>                            But besides,<br>\nSeeing they feign that not all bodies press<br>\nTo centre inward, rather only those<br>\nOf earth and water (liquid of the sea,<br>\nAnd the big billows from the mountain slopes,<br>\nAnd whatsoever are encased, as ‘twere,<br>\nIn earthen body), contrariwise, they teach<br>\nHow the thin air, and with it the hot fire,<br>\nIs borne asunder from the centre, and how,<br>\nFor this all ether quivers with bright stars,<br>\nAnd the sun’s flame along the blue is fed<br>\n(Because the heat, from out the centre flying,<br>\nAll gathers there), and how, again, the boughs<br>\nUpon the tree-tops could not sprout their leaves,<br>\nUnless, little by little, from out the earth<br>\nFor each were nutriment…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Lest, after the manner of the winged flames,<br>\nThe ramparts of the world should flee away,<br>\nDissolved amain throughout the mighty void,<br>\nAnd lest all else should likewise follow after,<br>\nAye, lest the thundering vaults of heaven should burst<br>\nAnd splinter upward, and the earth forthwith<br>\nWithdraw from under our feet, and all its bulk,<br>\nAmong its mingled wrecks and those of heaven,<br>\nWith slipping asunder of the primal seeds,<br>\nShould pass, along the immeasurable inane,<br>\nAway forever, and, that instant, naught<br>\nOf wrack and remnant would be left, beside<br>\nThe desolate space, and germs invisible.<br>\nFor on whatever side thou deemest first<br>\nThe primal bodies lacking, lo, that side<br>\nWill be for things the very door of death:<br>\nWherethrough the throng of matter all will dash,<br>\nOut and abroad.</p>\n<p>              These points, if thou wilt ponder,<br>\nThen, with but paltry trouble led along…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For one thing after other will grow clear,<br>\nNor shall the blind night rob thee of the road,<br>\nTo hinder thy gaze on nature’s Farthest-forth.<br>\nThus things for things shall kindle torches new.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/ii/proem/\">BOOK II - PROEM</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Now learn of what remains!
