But if of azure seeds<br>\nConsist the level waters of the deep,<br>\nThey could in nowise whiten: for however<br>\nThou shakest azure seeds, the same can never<br>\nPass into marble hue. But, if the seeds—<br>\nWhich thus produce the ocean’s one pure sheen—<br>\nBe now with one hue, now another dyed,<br>\nAs oft from alien forms and divers shapes<br>\nA cube’s produced all uniform in shape,<br>\n‘Twould be but natural, even as in the cube<br>\nWe see the forms to be dissimilar,<br>\nThat thus we’d see in brightness of the deep<br>\n(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt)<br>\nColours diverse and all dissimilar.<br>\nBesides, the unlike shapes don’t thwart the least<br>\nThe whole in being externally a cube;<br>\nBut differing hues of things do block and keep<br>\nThe whole from being of one resultant hue.<br>\nThen, too, the reason which entices us<br>\nAt times to attribute colours to the seeds<br>\nFalls quite to pieces, since white things are not<br>\nCreate from white things, nor are black from black,<br>\nBut evermore they are create from things<br>\nOf divers colours. Verily, the white<br>\nWill rise more readily, is sooner born<br>\nOut of no colour, than of black or aught<br>\nWhich stands in hostile opposition thus.</p>\n<p>Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light,<br>\nAnd the primordials come not forth to light,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colour—<br>\nTruly, what kind of colour could there be<br>\nIn the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself<br>\nA colour changes, gleaming variedly,<br>\nWhen smote by vertical or slanting ray.<br>\nThus in the sunlight shows the down of doves<br>\nThat circles, garlanding, the nape and throat:<br>\nNow it is ruddy with a bright gold-bronze,<br>\nNow, by a strange sensation it becomes<br>\nGreen-emerald blended with the coral-red.<br>\nThe peacock’s tail, filled with the copious light,<br>\nChanges its colours likewise, when it turns.<br>\nWherefore, since by some blow of light begot,<br>\nWithout such blow these colours can’t become.</p>\n<p>And since the pupil of the eye receives<br>\nWithin itself one kind of blow, when said<br>\nTo feel a white hue, then another kind,<br>\nWhen feeling a black or any other hue,<br>\nAnd since it matters nothing with what hue<br>\nThe things thou touchest be perchance endowed,<br>\nBut rather with what sort of shape equipped,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour,<br>\nBut render forth sensations, as of touch,<br>\nThat vary with their varied forms.</p>\n<p>                                Besides,<br>\nSince special shapes have not a special colour,<br>\nAnd all formations of the primal germs<br>\nCan be of any sheen thou wilt, why, then,<br>\nAre not those objects which are of them made<br>\nSuffused, each kind with colours of every kind?<br>\nFor then ‘twere meet that ravens, as they fly,<br>\nShould dartle from white pinions a white sheen,<br>\nOr swans turn black from seed of black, or be<br>\nOf any single varied dye thou wilt.</p>\n<p>Again, the more an object’s rent to bits,<br>\nThe more thou see its colour fade away<br>\nLittle by little till ‘tis quite extinct;<br>\nAs happens when the gaudy linen’s picked<br>\nShred after shred away: the purple there,<br>\nPhoenician red, most brilliant of all dyes,<br>\nIs lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread;<br>\nHence canst perceive the fragments die away<br>\nFrom out their colour, long ere they depart<br>\nBack to the old primordials of things.<br>\nAnd, last, since thou concedest not all bodies<br>\nSend out a voice or smell, it happens thus<br>\nThat not to all thou givest sounds and smells.<br>\nSo, too, since we behold not all with eyes,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know some things there are as much<br>\nOrphaned of colour, as others without smell,<br>\nAnd reft of sound; and those the mind alert<br>\nNo less can apprehend than it can mark<br>\nThe things that lack some other qualities.</p>\n<p>But think not haply that the primal bodies<br>\nRemain despoiled alone of colour: so,<br>\nAre they from warmth dissevered and from cold<br>\nAnd from hot exhalations; and they move,<br>\nBoth sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw<br>\nNot any odour from their proper bodies.<br>\nJust as, when undertaking to prepare<br>\nA liquid balm of myrrh and marjoram,<br>\nAnd flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes<br>\nOdour of nectar, first of all behooves<br>\nThou seek, as far as find thou may and can,<br>\nThe inodorous olive-oil (which never sends<br>\nOne whiff of scent to nostrils), that it may<br>\nThe least debauch and ruin with sharp tang<br>\nThe odorous essence with its body mixed<br>\nAnd in it seethed. And on the same account<br>\nThe primal germs of things must not be thought<br>\nTo furnish colour in begetting things,<br>\nNor sound, since pow’rless they to send forth aught<br>\nFrom out themselves, nor any flavour, too,<br>\nNor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The rest; yet since these things are mortal all—<br>\nThe pliant mortal, with a body soft;<br>\nThe brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame;<br>\nThe hollow with a porous-all must be<br>\nDisjoined from the primal elements,<br>\nIf still we wish under the world to lay<br>\nImmortal ground-works, whereupon may rest<br>\nThe sum of weal and safety, lest for thee<br>\nAll things return to nothing utterly.</p>\n<p>Now, too: whate’er we see possessing sense<br>\nMust yet confessedly be stablished all<br>\nFrom elements insensate. And those signs,<br>\nSo clear to all and witnessed out of hand,<br>\nDo not refute this dictum nor oppose;<br>\nBut rather themselves do lead us by the hand,<br>\nCompelling belief that living things are born<br>\nOf elements insensate, as I say.<br>\nSooth, we may see from out the stinking dung<br>\nLive worms spring up, when, after soaking rains,<br>\nThe drenched earth rots; and all things change the same:<br>\nLo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures<br>\nInto the cattle, the cattle their nature change<br>\nInto our bodies, and from our body, oft<br>\nGrow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts<br>\nAnd mighty-winged birds. Thus nature changes<br>\nAll foods to living frames, and procreates<br>\nFrom them the senses of live creatures all,<br>\nIn manner about as she uncoils in flames<br>\nDry logs of wood and turns them all to fire.<br>\nAnd seest not, therefore, how it matters much<br>\nAfter what order are set the primal germs,<br>\nAnd with what other germs they all are mixed,<br>\nAnd what the motions that they give and get?</p>\n<p>But now, what is’t that strikes thy sceptic mind,<br>\nConstraining thee to sundry arguments<br>\nAgainst belief that from insensate germs<br>\nThe sensible is gendered?—Verily,<br>\n‘Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though mixed,<br>\nAre yet unable to gender vital sense.<br>\nAnd, therefore, ‘twill be well in these affairs<br>\nThis to remember: that I have not said<br>\nSenses are born, under conditions all,<br>\nFrom all things absolutely which create<br>\nObjects that feel; but much it matters here<br>\nFirstly, how small the seeds which thus compose<br>\nThe feeling thing, then, with what shapes endowed,<br>\nAnd lastly what they in positions be,<br>\nIn motions, in arrangements. Of which facts<br>\nNaught we perceive in logs of wood and clods;<br>\nAnd yet even these, when sodden by the rains,<br>\nGive birth to wormy grubs, because the bodies<br>\nOf matter, from their old arrangements stirred<br>\nBy the new factor, then combine anew<br>\nIn such a way as genders living things.</p>\n<p>Next, they who deem that feeling objects can<br>\nFrom feeling objects be create, and these,<br>\nIn turn, from others that are wont to feel</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When soft they make them; for all sense is linked<br>\nWith flesh, and thews, and veins—and such, we see,<br>\nAre fashioned soft and of a mortal frame.<br>\nYet be’t that these can last forever on:<br>\nThey’ll have the sense that’s proper to a part,<br>\nOr else be judged to have a sense the same<br>\nAs that within live creatures as a whole.<br>\nBut of themselves those parts can never feel,<br>\nFor all the sense in every member back<br>\nTo something else refers—a severed hand,<br>\nOr any other member of our frame,<br>\nItself alone cannot support sensation.<br>\nIt thus remains they must resemble, then,<br>\nLive creatures as a whole, to have the power<br>\nOf feeling sensation concordant in each part<br>\nWith the vital sense; and so they’re bound to feel<br>\nThe things we feel exactly as do we.<br>\nIf such the case, how, then, can they be named<br>\nThe primal germs of things, and how avoid<br>\nThe highways of destruction?—since they be<br>\nMere living things and living things be all<br>\nOne and the same with mortal. Grant they could,<br>\nYet by their meetings and their unions all,<br>\nNaught would result, indeed, besides a throng<br>\nAnd hurly-burly all of living things—<br>\nPrecisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts,<br>\nBy mere conglomeration each with each<br>\nCan still beget not anything of new.<br>\nBut if by chance they lose, inside a body,<br>\nTheir own sense and another sense take on,<br>\nWhat, then, avails it to assign them that<br>\nWhich is withdrawn thereafter? And besides,<br>\nTo touch on proof that we pronounced before,<br>\nJust as we see the eggs of feathered fowls<br>\nTo change to living chicks, and swarming worms<br>\nTo bubble forth when from the soaking rains<br>\nThe earth is sodden, sure, sensations all<br>\nCan out of non-sensations be begot.</p>\n<p>But if one say that sense can so far rise<br>\nFrom non-sense by mutation, or because<br>\nBrought forth as by a certain sort of birth,<br>\n‘Twill serve to render plain to him and prove<br>\nThere is no birth, unless there be before<br>\nSome formed union of the elements,<br>\nNor any change, unless they be unite.</p>\n<p>In first place, senses can’t in body be<br>\nBefore its living nature’s been begot,—<br>\nSince all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed<br>\nAbout through rivers, air, and earth, and all<br>\nThat is from earth created, nor has met<br>\nIn combination, and, in proper mode,<br>\nConjoined into those vital motions which<br>\nKindle the all-perceiving senses—they<br>\nThat keep and guard each living thing soever.</p>\n<p>Again, a blow beyond its nature’s strength<br>\nShatters forthwith each living thing soe’er,<br>\nAnd on it goes confounding all the sense<br>\nOf body and mind. For of the primal germs<br>\nAre loosed their old arrangements, and, throughout,<br>\nThe vital motions blocked,—until the stuff,<br>\nShaken profoundly through the frame entire,<br>\nUndoes the vital knots of soul from body<br>\nAnd throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed,<br>\nThrough all the pores. For what may we surmise<br>\nA blow inflicted can achieve besides<br>\nShaking asunder and loosening all apart?<br>\nIt happens also, when less sharp the blow,<br>\nThe vital motions which are left are wont<br>\nOft to win out—win out, and stop and still<br>\nThe uncouth tumults gendered by the blow,<br>\nAnd call each part to its own courses back,<br>\nAnd shake away the motion of death which now<br>\nBegins its own dominion in the body,<br>\nAnd kindle anew the senses almost gone.<br>\nFor by what other means could they the more<br>\nCollect their powers of thought and turn again<br>\nFrom very doorways of destruction<br>\nBack unto life, rather than pass whereto<br>\nThey be already well-nigh sped and so<br>\nPass quite away?</p>\n<p>                Again, since pain is there<br>\nWhere bodies of matter, by some force stirred up,<br>\nThrough vitals and through joints, within their seats<br>\nQuiver and quake inside, but soft delight,<br>\nWhen they remove unto their place again:<br>\n‘Tis thine to know the primal germs can be<br>\nAssaulted by no pain, nor from themselves<br>\nTake no delight; because indeed they are<br>\nNot made of any bodies of first things,<br>\nUnder whose strange new motions they might ache<br>\nOr pluck the fruit of any dear new sweet.<br>\nAnd so they must be furnished with no sense.</p>\n<p>Once more, if thus, that every living thing<br>\nMay have sensation, needful ‘tis to assign<br>\nSense also to its elements, what then<br>\nOf those fixed elements from which mankind<br>\nHath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed?<br>\nOf verity, they’ll laugh aloud, like men,<br>\nShaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,<br>\nOr sprinkle with dewy tear-drops cheeks and chins,<br>\nAnd have the cunning hardihood to say<br>\nMuch on the composition of the world,<br>\nAnd in their turn inquire what elements<br>\nThey have themselves,—since, thus the same in kind<br>\nAs a whole mortal creature, even they<br>\nMust also be from other elements,<br>\nAnd then those others from others evermore—<br>\nSo that thou darest nowhere make a stop.<br>\nOho, I’ll follow thee until thou grant<br>\nThe seed (which here thou say’st speaks, laughs, and<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p>                             thinks)<br>\nIs yet derived out of other seeds<br>\nWhich in their turn are doing just the same.<br>\nBut if we see what raving nonsense this,<br>\nAnd that a man may laugh, though not, forsooth,<br>\nCompounded out of laughing elements,<br>\nAnd think and utter reason with learn’d speech,<br>\nThough not himself compounded, for a fact,<br>\nOf sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then,<br>\nCannot those things which we perceive to have<br>\nTheir own sensation be composed as well<br>\nOf intermixed seeds quite void of sense?</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/ii/infinite-worlds/\">BOOK II - INFINITE
