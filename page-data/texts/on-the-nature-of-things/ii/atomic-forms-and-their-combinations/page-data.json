Lastly, with any grain,<br>\nThou’lt see that no one kernel in one kind<br>\nIs so far like another, that there still<br>\nIs not in shapes some difference running through.<br>\nBy a like law we see how earth is pied<br>\nWith shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea<br>\nBeats on the thirsty sands of curving shores.<br>\nWherefore again, again, since seeds of things<br>\nExist by nature, nor were wrought with hands<br>\nAfter a fixed pattern of one other,<br>\nThey needs must flitter to and fro with shapes<br>\nIn types dissimilar to one another.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Easy enough by thought of mind to solve<br>\nWhy fires of lightning more can penetrate<br>\nThan these of ours from pitch-pine born on earth.<br>\nFor thou canst say lightning’s celestial fire,<br>\nSo subtle, is formed of figures finer far,<br>\nAnd passes thus through holes which this our fire,<br>\nBorn from the wood, created from the pine,<br>\nCannot. Again, light passes through the horn<br>\nOn the lantern’s side, while rain is dashed away.<br>\nAnd why?—unless those bodies of light should be<br>\nFiner than those of water’s genial showers.<br>\nWe see how quickly through a colander<br>\nThe wines will flow; how, on the other hand,<br>\nThe sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt,<br>\nBecause ‘tis wrought of elements more large,<br>\nOr else more crook’d and intertangled. Thus<br>\nIt comes that the primordials cannot be<br>\nSo suddenly sundered one from other, and seep,<br>\nOne through each several hole of anything.</p>\n<p>And note, besides, that liquor of honey or milk<br>\nYields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue,<br>\nWhilst nauseous wormwood, pungent centaury,<br>\nWith their foul flavour set the lips awry;<br>\nThus simple ‘tis to see that whatsoever<br>\nCan touch the senses pleasingly are made<br>\nOf smooth and rounded elements, whilst those<br>\nWhich seem the bitter and the sharp, are held<br>\nEntwined by elements more crook’d, and so<br>\nAre wont to tear their ways into our senses,<br>\nAnd rend our body as they enter in.<br>\nIn short all good to sense, all bad to touch,<br>\nBeing up-built of figures so unlike,<br>\nAre mutually at strife—lest thou suppose<br>\nThat the shrill rasping of a squeaking saw<br>\nConsists of elements as smooth as song<br>\nWhich, waked by nimble fingers, on the strings<br>\nThe sweet musicians fashion; or suppose<br>\nThat same-shaped atoms through men’s nostrils pierce<br>\nWhen foul cadavers burn, as when the stage<br>\nIs with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh,<br>\nAnd the altar near exhales Panchaean scent;<br>\nOr hold as of like seed the goodly hues<br>\nOf things which feast our eyes, as those which sting<br>\nAgainst the smarting pupil and draw tears,<br>\nOr show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile.<br>\nFor never a shape which charms our sense was made<br>\nWithout some elemental smoothness; whilst<br>\nWhate’er is harsh and irksome has been framed<br>\nStill with some roughness in its elements.<br>\nSome, too, there are which justly are supposed<br>\nTo be nor smooth nor altogether hooked,<br>\nWith bended barbs, but slightly angled-out,<br>\nTo tickle rather than to wound the sense—<br>\nAnd of which sort is the salt tartar of wine<br>\nAnd flavours of the gummed elecampane.<br>\nAgain, that glowing fire and icy rime<br>\nAre fanged with teeth unlike whereby to sting<br>\nOur body’s sense, the touch of each gives proof.<br>\nFor touch—by sacred majesties of Gods!—<br>\nTouch is indeed the body’s only sense—<br>\nBe’t that something in-from-outward works,<br>\nBe’t that something in the body born<br>\nWounds, or delighteth as it passes out<br>\nAlong the procreant paths of Aphrodite;<br>\nOr be’t the seeds by some collision whirl<br>\nDisordered in the body and confound<br>\nBy tumult and confusion all the sense—<br>\nAs thou mayst find, if haply with the hand<br>\nThyself thou strike thy body’s any part.<br>\nOn which account, the elemental forms<br>\nMust differ widely, as enabled thus<br>\nTo cause diverse sensations.</p>\n<p>                          And, again,<br>\nWhat seems to us the hardened and condensed<br>\nMust be of atoms among themselves more hooked,<br>\nBe held compacted deep within, as ‘twere<br>\nBy branch-like atoms—of which sort the chief<br>\nAre diamond stones, despisers of all blows,<br>\nAnd stalwart flint and strength of solid iron,<br>\nAnd brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,<br>\nDo grate and scream. But what are liquid, formed<br>\nOf fluid body, they indeed must be<br>\nOf elements more smooth and round—because<br>\nTheir globules severally will not cohere:<br>\nTo suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand<br>\nIs quite as easy as drinking water down,<br>\nAnd they, once struck, roll like unto the same.<br>\nBut that thou seest among the things that flow<br>\nSome bitter, as the brine of ocean is,<br>\nIs not the least a marvel…<br>\nFor since ‘tis fluid, smooth its atoms are<br>\nAnd round, with painful rough ones mixed therein;<br>\nYet need not these be held together hooked:<br>\nIn fact, though rough, they’re globular besides,<br>\nAble at once to roll, and rasp the sense.<br>\nAnd that the more thou mayst believe me here,<br>\nThat with smooth elements are mixed the rough<br>\n(Whence Neptune’s salt astringent body comes),<br>\nThere is a means to separate the twain,<br>\nAnd thereupon dividedly to see<br>\nHow the sweet water, after filtering through<br>\nSo often underground, flows freshened forth<br>\nInto some hollow; for it leaves above<br>\nThe primal germs of nauseating brine,<br>\nSince cling the rough more readily in earth.<br>\nLastly, whatso thou markest to disperse<br>\nUpon the instant—smoke, and cloud, and flame—<br>\nMust not (even though not all of smooth and round)<br>\nBe yet co-linked with atoms intertwined,<br>\nThat thus they can, without together cleaving,<br>\nSo pierce our body and so bore the rocks.<br>\nWhatever we see…<br>\nGiven to senses, that thou must perceive<br>\nThey’re not from linked but pointed elements.</p>\n<p>The which now having taught, I will go on<br>\nTo bind thereto a fact to this allied<br>\nAnd drawing from this its proof: these primal germs<br>\nVary, yet only with finite tale of shapes.<br>\nFor were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds<br>\nWould have a body of infinite increase.<br>\nFor in one seed, in one small frame of any,<br>\nThe shapes can’t vary from one another much.<br>\nAssume, we’ll say, that of three minim parts<br>\nConsist the primal bodies, or add a few:<br>\nWhen, now, by placing all these parts of one<br>\nAt top and bottom, changing lefts and rights,<br>\nThou hast with every kind of shift found out<br>\nWhat the aspect of shape of its whole body<br>\nEach new arrangement gives, for what remains,<br>\nIf thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,<br>\nNew parts must then be added; follows next,<br>\nIf thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,<br>\nThat by like logic each arrangement still<br>\nRequires its increment of other parts.<br>\nErgo, an augmentation of its frame<br>\nFollows upon each novelty of forms.<br>\nWherefore, it cannot be thou’lt undertake<br>\nThat seeds have infinite differences in form,<br>\nLest thus thou forcest some indeed to be<br>\nOf an immeasurable immensity—<br>\nWhich I have taught above cannot be proved.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And now for thee barbaric robes, and gleam<br>\nOf Meliboean purple, touched with dye<br>\nOf the Thessalian shell…<br>\nThe peacock’s golden generations, stained<br>\nWith spotted gaieties, would lie o’erthrown<br>\nBy some new colour of new things more bright;<br>\nThe odour of myrrh and savours of honey despised;<br>\nThe swan’s old lyric, and Apollo’s hymns,<br>\nOnce modulated on the many chords,<br>\nWould likewise sink o’ermastered and be mute:<br>\nFor, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest,<br>\nWould be arising evermore. So, too,<br>\nInto some baser part might all retire,<br>\nEven as we said to better might they come:<br>\nFor, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest<br>\nTo nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of tongue,<br>\nWould then, by reasoning reversed, be there.<br>\nSince ‘tis not so, but unto things are given<br>\nTheir fixed limitations which do bound<br>\nTheir sum on either side, ‘tmust be confessed<br>\nThat matter, too, by finite tale of shapes<br>\nDoes differ. Again, from earth’s midsummer heats<br>\nUnto the icy hoar-frosts of the year<br>\nThe forward path is fixed, and by like law<br>\nO’ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring.<br>\nFor each degree of hot, and each of cold,<br>\nAnd the half-warm, all filling up the sum<br>\nIn due progression, lie, my Memmius, there<br>\nBetwixt the two extremes: the things create<br>\nMust differ, therefore, by a finite change,<br>\nSince at each end marked off they ever are<br>\nBy fixed point—on one side plagued by flames<br>\nAnd on the other by congealing frosts.</p>\n<p>The which now having taught, I will go on<br>\nTo bind thereto a fact to this allied<br>\nAnd drawing from this its proof: those primal germs<br>\nWhich have been fashioned all of one like shape<br>\nAre infinite in tale; for, since the forms<br>\nThemselves are finite in divergences,<br>\nThen those which are alike will have to be<br>\nInfinite, else the sum of stuff remains<br>\nA finite—what I’ve proved is not the fact,<br>\nShowing in verse how corpuscles of stuff,<br>\nFrom everlasting and to-day the same,<br>\nUphold the sum of things, all sides around<br>\nBy old succession of unending blows.<br>\nFor though thou view’st some beasts to be more rare,<br>\nAnd mark’st in them a less prolific stock,<br>\nYet in another region, in lands remote,<br>\nThat kind abounding may make up the count;<br>\nEven as we mark among the four-foot kind<br>\nSnake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall<br>\nWith ivory ramparts India about,<br>\nThat her interiors cannot entered be—<br>\nSo big her count of brutes of which we see<br>\nSuch few examples. Or suppose, besides,<br>\nWe feign some thing, one of its kind and sole<br>\nWith body born, to which is nothing like<br>\nIn all the lands: yet now unless shall be<br>\nAn infinite count of matter out of which<br>\nThus to conceive and bring it forth to life,<br>\nIt cannot be created and—what’s more—<br>\nIt cannot take its food and get increase.<br>\nYea, if through all the world in finite tale<br>\nBe tossed the procreant bodies of one thing,<br>\nWhence, then, and where in what mode, by what power,<br>\nShall they to meeting come together there,<br>\nIn such vast ocean of matter and tumult strange?—<br>\nNo means they have of joining into one.<br>\nBut, just as, after mighty ship-wrecks piled,<br>\nThe mighty main is wont to scatter wide<br>\nThe rowers’ banks, the ribs, the yards, the prow,<br>\nThe masts and swimming oars, so that afar<br>\nAlong all shores of lands are seen afloat<br>\nThe carven fragments of the rended poop,<br>\nGiving a lesson to mortality<br>\nTo shun the ambush of the faithless main,<br>\nThe violence and the guile, and trust it not<br>\nAt any hour, however much may smile<br>\nThe crafty enticements of the placid deep:<br>\nExactly thus, if once thou holdest true<br>\nThat certain seeds are finite in their tale,<br>\nThe various tides of matter, then, must needs<br>\nScatter them flung throughout the ages all,<br>\nSo that not ever can they join, as driven<br>\nTogether into union, nor remain<br>\nIn union, nor with increment can grow—<br>\nBut facts in proof are manifest for each:<br>\nThings can be both begotten and increase.<br>\n‘Tis therefore manifest that primal germs,<br>\nAre infinite in any class thou wilt—<br>\nFrom whence is furnished matter for all things.</p>\n<p>Nor can those motions that bring death prevail<br>\nForever, nor eternally entomb<br>\nThe welfare of the world; nor, further, can<br>\nThose motions that give birth to things and growth<br>\nKeep them forever when created there.<br>\nThus the long war, from everlasting waged,<br>\nWith equal strife among the elements<br>\nGoes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail<br>\nThe vital forces of the world—or fall.<br>\nMixed with the funeral is the wildered wail<br>\nOf infants coming to the shores of light:<br>\nNo night a day, no dawn a night hath followed<br>\nThat heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries,<br>\nThe wild laments, companions old of death<br>\nAnd the black rites.</p>\n<p>                     This, too, in these affairs<br>\n‘Tis fit thou hold well sealed, and keep consigned<br>\nWith no forgetting brain: nothing there is<br>\nWhose nature is apparent out of hand<br>\nThat of one kind of elements consists—<br>\nNothing there is that’s not of mixed seed.<br>\nAnd whatsoe’er possesses in itself<br>\nMore largely many powers and properties<br>\nShows thus that here within itself there are<br>\nThe largest number of kinds and differing shapes<br>\nOf elements. And, chief of all, the earth<br>\nHath in herself first bodies whence the springs,<br>\nRolling chill waters, renew forevermore<br>\nThe unmeasured main; hath whence the fires arise—<br>\nFor burns in many a spot her flamed crust,<br>\nWhilst the impetuous Aetna raves indeed<br>\nFrom more profounder fires—and she, again,<br>\nHath in herself the seed whence she can raise<br>\nThe shining grains and gladsome trees for men;<br>\nWhence, also, rivers, fronds, and gladsome pastures<br>\nCan she supply for mountain-roaming beasts.<br>\nWherefore great mother of gods, and mother of beasts,<br>\nAnd parent of man hath she alone been named.</p>\n<p>Her hymned the old and learned bards of Greece</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Seated in chariot o’er the realms of air<br>\nTo drive her team of lions, teaching thus<br>\nThat the great earth hangs poised and cannot lie<br>\nResting on other earth. Unto her car<br>\nThey’ve yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny,<br>\nHowever savage, must be tamed and chid<br>\nBy care of parents. They have girt about<br>\nWith turret-crown the summit of her head,<br>\nSince, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high,<br>\n‘Tis she sustains the cities; now, adorned<br>\nWith that same token, to-day is carried forth,<br>\nWith solemn awe through many a mighty land,<br>\nThe image of that mother, the divine.<br>\nHer the wide nations, after antique rite,<br>\nDo name Idaean Mother, giving her<br>\nEscort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say,<br>\nFrom out those regions ‘twas that grain began<br>\nThrough all the world. To her do they assign<br>\nThe Galli, the emasculate, since thus<br>\nThey wish to show that men who violate<br>\nThe majesty of the mother and have proved<br>\nIngrate to parents are to be adjudged<br>\nUnfit to give unto the shores of light<br>\nA living progeny. The Galli come:<br>\nAnd hollow cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines<br>\nResound around to bangings of their hands;<br>\nThe fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray;<br>\nThe tubed pipe excites their maddened minds<br>\nIn Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives,<br>\nWild emblems of their frenzy, which have power<br>\nThe rabble’s ingrate heads and impious hearts<br>\nTo panic with terror of the goddess’ might.<br>\nAnd so, when through the mighty cities borne,<br>\nShe blesses man with salutations mute,<br>\nThey strew the highway of her journeyings<br>\nWith coin of brass and silver, gifting her<br>\nWith alms and largesse, and shower her and shade<br>\nWith flowers of roses falling like the snow<br>\nUpon the Mother and her companion-bands.<br>\nHere is an armed troop, the which by Greeks<br>\nAre called the Phrygian Curetes. Since<br>\nHaply among themselves they use to play<br>\nIn games of arms and leap in measure round<br>\nWith bloody mirth and by their nodding shake<br>\nThe terrorizing crests upon their heads,<br>\nThis is the armed troop that represents<br>\nThe arm’d Dictaean Curetes, who, in Crete,<br>\nAs runs the story, whilom did out-drown<br>\nThat infant cry of Zeus, what time their band,<br>\nYoung boys, in a swift dance around the boy,<br>\nTo measured step beat with the brass on brass,<br>\nThat Saturn might not get him for his jaws,<br>\nAnd give its mother an eternal wound<br>\nAlong her heart. And ‘tis on this account<br>\nThat armed they escort the mighty Mother,<br>\nOr else because they signify by this<br>\nThat she, the goddess, teaches men to be<br>\nEager with armed valour to defend<br>\nTheir motherland, and ready to stand forth,<br>\nThe guard and glory of their parents’ years.<br>\nA tale, however beautifully wrought,<br>\nThat’s wide of reason by a long remove:<br>\nFor all the gods must of themselves enjoy<br>\nImmortal aeons and supreme repose,<br>\nWithdrawn from our affairs, detached, afar:<br>\nImmune from peril and immune from pain,<br>\nThemselves abounding in riches of their own,<br>\nNeeding not us, they are not touched by wrath<br>\nThey are not taken by service or by gift.<br>\nTruly is earth insensate for all time;<br>\nBut, by obtaining germs of many things,<br>\nIn many a way she brings the many forth<br>\nInto the light of sun. And here, whoso<br>\nDecides to call the ocean Neptune, or<br>\nThe grain-crop Ceres, and prefers to abuse<br>\nThe name of Bacchus rather than pronounce<br>\nThe liquor’s proper designation, him<br>\nLet us permit to go on calling earth<br>\nMother of Gods, if only he will spare<br>\nTo taint his soul with foul religion.<br>\nSo, too, the wooly flocks, and horned kine,<br>\nAnd brood of battle-eager horses, grazing<br>\nOften together along one grassy plain,<br>\nUnder the cope of one blue sky, and slaking<br>\nFrom out one stream of water each its thirst,<br>\nAll live their lives with face and form unlike,<br>\nKeeping the parents’ nature, parents’ habits,<br>\nWhich, kind by kind, through ages they repeat.<br>\nSo great in any sort of herb thou wilt,<br>\nSo great again in any river of earth<br>\nAre the distinct diversities of matter.<br>\nHence, further, every creature—any one<br>\nFrom out them all—compounded is the same<br>\nOf bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and thews—<br>\nAll differing vastly in their forms, and built<br>\nOf elements dissimilar in shape.<br>\nAgain, all things by fire consumed ablaze,<br>\nWithin their frame lay up, if naught besides,<br>\nAt least those atoms whence derives their power<br>\nTo throw forth fire and send out light from under,<br>\nTo shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.<br>\nIf, with like reasoning of mind, all else<br>\nThou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus<br>\nThat in their frame the seeds of many things<br>\nThey hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.<br>\nFurther, thou markest much, to which are given<br>\nAlong together colour and flavour and smell,<br>\nAmong which, chief, are most burnt offerings.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thus must they be of divers shapes composed.<br>\nA smell of scorching enters in our frame<br>\nWhere the bright colour from the dye goes not;<br>\nAnd colour in one way, flavour in quite another<br>\nWorks inward to our senses—so mayst see<br>\nThey differ too in elemental shapes.<br>\nThus unlike forms into one mass combine,<br>\nAnd things exist by intermixed seed.</p>\n<p>But still ‘tmust not be thought that in all ways<br>\nAll things can be conjoined; for then wouldst view<br>\nPortents begot about thee every side:<br>\nHulks of mankind half brute astarting up,<br>\nAt times big branches sprouting from man’s trunk,<br>\nLimbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,<br>\nAnd nature along the all-producing earth<br>\nFeeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame<br>\nFrom hideous jaws—Of which ‘tis simple fact<br>\nThat none have been begot; because we see<br>\nAll are from fixed seed and fixed dam<br>\nEngendered and so function as to keep<br>\nThroughout their growth their own ancestral type.<br>\nThis happens surely by a fixed law:<br>\nFor from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,<br>\nGo sundered atoms, suited to each creature,<br>\nThroughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,<br>\nProduce the proper motions; but we see<br>\nHow, contrariwise, nature upon the ground<br>\nThrows off those foreign to their frame; and many<br>\nWith viewless bodies from their bodies fly,<br>\nBy blows impelled—those impotent to join<br>\nTo any part, or, when inside, to accord<br>\nAnd to take on the vital motions there.<br>\nBut think not, haply, living forms alone<br>\nAre bound by these laws: they distinguished all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For just as all things of creation are,<br>\nIn their whole nature, each to each unlike,<br>\nSo must their atoms be in shape unlike—<br>\nNot since few only are fashioned of like form,<br>\nBut since they all, as general rule, are not<br>\nThe same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,<br>\nElements many, common to many words,<br>\nThou seest, though yet ‘tis needful to confess<br>\nThe words and verses differ, each from each,<br>\nCompounded out of different elements—<br>\nNot since few only, as common letters, run<br>\nThrough all the words, or no two words are made,<br>\nOne and the other, from all like elements,<br>\nBut since they all, as general rule, are not<br>\nThe same as all. Thus, too, in other things,<br>\nWhilst many germs common to many things<br>\nThere are, yet they, combined among themselves,<br>\nCan form new wholes to others quite unlike.<br>\nThus fairly one may say that humankind,<br>\nThe grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up<br>\nOf different atoms.
