For this reason too ‘tis fit<br>\nThou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies<br>\nWhich here are witnessed tumbling in the light:<br>\nNamely, because such tumblings are a sign<br>\nThat motions also of the primal stuff<br>\nSecret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.<br>\nFor thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled<br>\nBy viewless blows, to change its little course,<br>\nAnd beaten backwards to return again,<br>\nHither and thither in all directions round.<br>\nLo, all their shifting movement is of old,<br>\nFrom the primeval atoms; for the same<br>\nPrimordial seeds of things first move of self,<br>\nAnd then those bodies built of unions small<br>\nAnd nearest, as it were, unto the powers<br>\nOf the primeval atoms, are stirred up<br>\nBy impulse of those atoms’ unseen blows,<br>\nAnd these thereafter goad the next in size:<br>\nThus motion ascends from the primevals on,<br>\nAnd stage by stage emerges to our sense,<br>\nUntil those objects also move which we<br>\nCan mark in sunbeams, though it not appears<br>\nWhat blows do urge them.</p>\n<p>                       Herein wonder not<br>\nHow ‘tis that, while the seeds of things are all<br>\nMoving forever, the sum yet seems to stand<br>\nSupremely still, except in cases where<br>\nA thing shows motion of its frame as whole.<br>\nFor far beneath the ken of senses lies<br>\nThe nature of those ultimates of the world;<br>\nAnd so, since those themselves thou canst not see,<br>\nTheir motion also must they veil from men—<br>\nFor mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft<br>\nYet hide their motions, when afar from us<br>\nAlong the distant landscape. Often thus,<br>\nUpon a hillside will the woolly flocks<br>\nBe cropping their goodly food and creeping about<br>\nWhither the summons of the grass, begemmed<br>\nWith the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs,<br>\nWell filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:<br>\nYet all for us seem blurred and blent afar—<br>\nA glint of white at rest on a green hill.<br>\nAgain, when mighty legions, marching round,<br>\nFill all the quarters of the plains below,<br>\nRousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen<br>\nShoots up the sky, and all the fields about<br>\nGlitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound<br>\nGoes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,<br>\nAnd mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send<br>\nThe voices onward to the stars of heaven,<br>\nAnd hither and thither darts the cavalry,<br>\nAnd of a sudden down the midmost fields<br>\nCharges with onset stout enough to rock<br>\nThe solid earth: and yet some post there is<br>\nUp the high mountains, viewed from which they seem<br>\nTo stand—a gleam at rest along the plains.</p>\n<p>Now what the speed to matter’s atoms given<br>\nThou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from this:<br>\nWhen first the dawn is sprinkling with new light<br>\nThe lands, and all the breed of birds abroad<br>\nFlit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes<br>\nFilling the regions along the mellow air,<br>\nWe see ‘tis forthwith manifest to man<br>\nHow suddenly the risen sun is wont<br>\nAt such an hour to overspread and clothe<br>\nThe whole with its own splendour; but the sun’s<br>\nWarm exhalations and this serene light<br>\nTravel not down an empty void; and thus<br>\nThey are compelled more slowly to advance,<br>\nWhilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air;<br>\nNor one by one travel these particles<br>\nOf the warm exhalations, but are all<br>\nEntangled and enmassed, whereby at once<br>\nEach is restrained by each, and from without<br>\nChecked, till compelled more slowly to advance.<br>\nBut the primordial atoms with their old<br>\nSimple solidity, when forth they travel<br>\nAlong the empty void, all undelayed<br>\nBy aught outside them there, and they, each one<br>\nBeing one unit from nature of its parts,<br>\nAre borne to that one place on which they strive<br>\nStill to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt,<br>\nOutstrip in speed, and be more swiftly borne<br>\nThan light of sun, and over regions rush,<br>\nOf space much vaster, in the self-same time<br>\nThe sun’s effulgence widens round the sky.</p>\n<p>Nor to pursue the atoms one by one,<br>\nTo see the law whereby each thing goes on.<br>\nBut some men, ignorant of matter, think,<br>\nOpposing this, that not without the gods,<br>\nIn such adjustment to our human ways,<br>\nCan nature change the seasons of the years,<br>\nAnd bring to birth the grains and all of else<br>\nTo which divine Delight, the guide of life,<br>\nPersuades mortality and leads it on,<br>\nThat, through her artful blandishments of love,<br>\nIt propagate the generations still,<br>\nLest humankind should perish. When they feign<br>\nThat gods have stablished all things but for man,<br>\nThey seem in all ways mightily to lapse<br>\nFrom reason’s truth: for ev’n if ne’er I knew<br>\nWhat seeds primordial are, yet would I dare<br>\nThis to affirm, ev’n from deep judgment based<br>\nUpon the ways and conduct of the skies—<br>\nThis to maintain by many a fact besides—<br>\nThat in no wise the nature of the world<br>\nFor us was builded by a power divine—<br>\nSo great the faults it stands encumbered with:<br>\nThe which, my Memmius, later on, for thee<br>\nWe will clear up. Now as to what remains<br>\nConcerning motions we’ll unfold our thought.</p>\n<p>Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs<br>\nTo prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal<br>\nOf its own force can e’er be upward borne,<br>\nOr upward go—nor let the bodies of flames<br>\nDeceive thee here: for they engendered are<br>\nWith urge to upwards, taking thus increase,<br>\nWhereby grow upwards shining grains and trees,<br>\nThough all the weight within them downward bears.<br>\nNor, when the fires will leap from under round<br>\nThe roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up<br>\nTimber and beam, ‘tis then to be supposed<br>\nThey act of own accord, no force beneath<br>\nTo urge them up. ‘Tis thus that blood, discharged<br>\nFrom out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft<br>\nAnd spatters gore. And hast thou never marked<br>\nWith what a force the water will disgorge<br>\nTimber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,<br>\nWe push them in, and, many though we be,<br>\nThe more we press with main and toil, the more<br>\nThe water vomits up and flings them back,<br>\nThat, more than half their length, they there emerge,<br>\nRebounding. Yet we never doubt, meseems,<br>\nThat all the weight within them downward bears<br>\nThrough empty void. Well, in like manner, flames<br>\nOught also to be able, when pressed out,<br>\nThrough winds of air to rise aloft, even though<br>\nThe weight within them strive to draw them down.<br>\nHast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high,<br>\nThe meteors, midnight flambeaus of the sky,<br>\nHow after them they draw long trails of flame<br>\nWherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?<br>\nHow stars and constellations drop to earth,<br>\nSeest not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven<br>\nSheds round to every quarter its large heat,<br>\nAnd sows the new-ploughed intervales with light:<br>\nThus also sun’s heat downward tends to earth.<br>\nAthwart the rain thou seest the lightning fly;<br>\nNow here, now there, bursting from out the clouds,<br>\nThe fires dash zig-zag—and that flaming power<br>\nFalls likewise down to earth.</p>\n<p>                           In these affairs<br>\nWe wish thee also well aware of this:<br>\nThe atoms, as their own weight bears them down<br>\nPlumb through the void, at scarce determined times,<br>\nIn scarce determined places, from their course<br>\nDecline a little—call it, so to speak,<br>\nMere changed trend. For were it not their wont<br>\nThuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,<br>\nLike drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;<br>\nAnd then collisions ne’er could be nor blows<br>\nAmong the primal elements; and thus<br>\nNature would never have created aught.</p>\n<p>But, if perchance be any that believe<br>\nThe heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne<br>\nPlumb down the void, are able from above<br>\nTo strike the lighter, thus engendering blows<br>\nAble to cause those procreant motions, far<br>\nFrom highways of true reason they retire.<br>\nFor whatsoever through the waters fall,<br>\nOr through thin air, must quicken their descent,<br>\nEach after its weight—on this account, because<br>\nBoth bulk of water and the subtle air<br>\nBy no means can retard each thing alike,<br>\nBut give more quick before the heavier weight;<br>\nBut contrariwise the empty void cannot,<br>\nOn any side, at any time, to aught<br>\nOppose resistance, but will ever yield,<br>\nTrue to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,<br>\nWith equal speed, though equal not in weight,<br>\nMust rush, borne downward through the still inane.<br>\nThus ne’er at all have heavier from above<br>\nBeen swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes<br>\nWhich cause those divers motions, by whose means<br>\nNature transacts her work. And so I say,<br>\nThe atoms must a little swerve at times—<br>\nBut only the least, lest we should seem to feign<br>\nMotions oblique, and fact refute us there.<br>\nFor this we see forthwith is manifest:<br>\nWhatever the weight, it can’t obliquely go,<br>\nDown on its headlong journey from above,<br>\nAt least so far as thou canst mark; but who<br>\nIs there can mark by sense that naught can swerve<br>\nAt all aside from off its road’s straight line?</p>\n<p>Again, if ev’r all motions are co-linked,<br>\nAnd from the old ever arise the new<br>\nIn fixed order, and primordial seeds<br>\nProduce not by their swerving some new start<br>\nOf motion to sunder the covenants of fate,<br>\nThat cause succeed not cause from everlasting,<br>\nWhence this free will for creatures o’er the lands,<br>\nWhence is it wrested from the fates,—this will<br>\nWhereby we step right forward where desire<br>\nLeads each man on, whereby the same we swerve<br>\nIn motions, not as at some fixed time,<br>\nNor at some fixed line of space, but where<br>\nThe mind itself has urged? For out of doubt<br>\nIn these affairs ‘tis each man’s will itself<br>\nThat gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs<br>\nIncipient motions are diffused. Again,<br>\nDost thou not see, when, at a point of time,<br>\nThe bars are opened, how the eager strength<br>\nOf horses cannot forward break as soon<br>\nAs pants their mind to do? For it behooves<br>\nThat all the stock of matter, through the frame,<br>\nBe roused, in order that, through every joint,<br>\nAroused, it press and follow mind’s desire;<br>\nSo thus thou seest initial motion’s gendered<br>\nFrom out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds<br>\nFirst from the spirit’s will, whence at the last<br>\n‘Tis given forth through joints and body entire.<br>\nQuite otherwise it is, when forth we move,<br>\nImpelled by a blow of another’s mighty powers<br>\nAnd mighty urge; for then ‘tis clear enough<br>\nAll matter of our total body goes,<br>\nHurried along, against our own desire—<br>\nUntil the will has pulled upon the reins<br>\nAnd checked it back, throughout our members all;<br>\nAt whose arbitrament indeed sometimes<br>\nThe stock of matter’s forced to change its path,<br>\nThroughout our members and throughout our joints,<br>\nAnd, after being forward cast, to be<br>\nReined up, whereat it settles back again.<br>\nSo seest thou not, how, though external force<br>\nDrive men before, and often make them move,<br>\nOnward against desire, and headlong snatched,<br>\nYet is there something in these breasts of ours<br>\nStrong to combat, strong to withstand the same?—<br>\nWherefore no less within the primal seeds<br>\nThou must admit, besides all blows and weight,<br>\nSome other cause of motion, whence derives<br>\nThis power in us inborn, of some free act.—<br>\nSince naught from nothing can become, we see.<br>\nFor weight prevents all things should come to pass<br>\nThrough blows, as ‘twere, by some external force;<br>\nBut that man’s mind itself in all it does<br>\nHath not a fixed necessity within,<br>\nNor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled<br>\nTo bear and suffer,—this state comes to man<br>\nFrom that slight swervement of the elements<br>\nIn no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.<br></p>\n<p>Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed,<br>\nNor ever, again, sundered by bigger gaps:<br>\nFor naught gives increase and naught takes away;<br>\nOn which account, just as they move to-day,<br>\nThe elemental bodies moved of old<br>\nAnd shall the same hereafter evermore.<br>\nAnd what was wont to be begot of old<br>\nShall be begotten under selfsame terms<br>\nAnd grow and thrive in power, so far as given<br>\nTo each by Nature’s changeless, old decrees.<br>\nThe sum of things there is no power can change,<br>\nFor naught exists outside, to which can flee<br>\nOut of the world matter of any kind,<br>\nNor forth from which a fresh supply can spring,<br>\nBreak in upon the founded world, and change<br>\nWhole nature of things, and turn their motions about.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/ii/atomic-forms-and-their-combinations/\">BOOK II -
