What was before from earth,<br>\nThe same in earth sinks back, and what was sent<br>\nFrom shores of ether, that, returning home,<br>\nThe vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death<br>\nSo far annihilate things that she destroys<br>\nThe bodies of matter; but she dissipates<br>\nTheir combinations, and conjoins anew<br>\nOne element with others; and contrives<br>\nThat all things vary forms and change their colours<br>\nAnd get sensations and straight give them o’er.<br>\nAnd thus may’st know it matters with what others<br>\nAnd in what structure the primordial germs<br>\nAre held together, and what motions they<br>\nAmong themselves do give and get; nor think<br>\nThat aught we see hither and thither afloat<br>\nUpon the crest of things, and now a birth<br>\nAnd straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest<br>\nDeep in the eternal atoms of the world.</p>\n<p>Why, even in these our very verses here<br>\nIt matters much with what and in what order<br>\nEach element is set: the same denote<br>\nSky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and sun;<br>\nThe same, the grains, and trees, and living things.<br>\nAnd if not all alike, at least the most—<br>\nBut what distinctions by positions wrought!<br>\nAnd thus no less in things themselves, when once<br>\nAround are changed the intervals between,<br>\nThe paths of matter, its connections, weights,<br>\nBlows, clashings, motions, order, structure, shapes,<br>\nThe things themselves must likewise changed be.</p>\n<p>Now to true reason give thy mind for us.<br>\nSince here strange truth is putting forth its might<br>\nTo hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect<br>\nOf things to show its front. Yet naught there is<br>\nSo easy that it standeth not at first<br>\nMore hard to credit than it after is;<br>\nAnd naught soe’er that’s great to such degree,<br>\nNor wonderful so far, but all mankind<br>\nLittle by little abandon their surprise.<br>\nLook upward yonder at the bright clear sky<br>\nAnd what it holds—the stars that wander o’er,<br>\nThe moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun:<br>\nYet all, if now they first for mortals were,<br>\nIf unforeseen now first asudden shown,<br>\nWhat might there be more wonderful to tell,<br>\nWhat that the nations would before have dared<br>\nLess to believe might be?—I fancy, naught—<br>\nSo strange had been the marvel of that sight.<br>\nThe which o’erwearied to behold, to-day<br>\nNone deigns look upward to those lucent realms.<br>\nThen, spew not reason from thy mind away,<br>\nBeside thyself because the matter’s new,<br>\nBut rather with keen judgment nicely weigh;<br>\nAnd if to thee it then appeareth true,<br>\nRender thy hands, or, if ‘tis false at last,<br>\nGird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man<br>\nNow seeks the nature of the vast Beyond<br>\nThere on the other side, that boundless sum<br>\nWhich lies without the ramparts of the world,<br>\nToward which the spirit longs to peer afar,<br>\nToward which indeed the swift elan of thought<br>\nFlies unencumbered forth.</p>\n<p>                         Firstly, we find,<br>\nOff to all regions round, on either side,<br>\nAbove, beneath, throughout the universe<br>\nEnd is there none—as I have taught, as too<br>\nThe very thing of itself declares aloud,<br>\nAnd as from nature of the unbottomed deep<br>\nShines clearly forth. Nor can we once suppose<br>\nIn any way ‘tis likely, (seeing that space<br>\nTo all sides stretches infinite and free,<br>\nAnd seeds, innumerable in number, in sum<br>\nBottomless, there in many a manner fly,<br>\nBestirred in everlasting motion there),<br>\nThat only this one earth and sky of ours<br>\nHath been create and that those bodies of stuff,<br>\nSo many, perform no work outside the same;<br>\nSeeing, moreover, this world too hath been<br>\nBy nature fashioned, even as seeds of things<br>\nBy innate motion chanced to clash and cling—<br>\nAfter they’d been in many a manner driven<br>\nTogether at random, without design, in vain—<br>\nAnd as at last those seeds together dwelt,<br>\nWhich, when together of a sudden thrown,<br>\nShould alway furnish the commencements fit<br>\nOf mighty things—the earth, the sea, the sky,<br>\nAnd race of living creatures. Thus, I say,<br>\nAgain, again, ‘tmust be confessed there are<br>\nSuch congregations of matter otherwhere,<br>\nLike this our world which vasty ether holds<br>\nIn huge embrace.</p>\n<p>                Besides, when matter abundant<br>\nIs ready there, when space on hand, nor object<br>\nNor any cause retards, no marvel ‘tis<br>\nThat things are carried on and made complete,<br>\nPerforce. And now, if store of seeds there is<br>\nSo great that not whole life-times of the living<br>\nCan count the tale…<br>\nAnd if their force and nature abide the same,<br>\nAble to throw the seeds of things together<br>\nInto their places, even as here are thrown<br>\nThe seeds together in this world of ours,<br>\n‘Tmust be confessed in other realms there are<br>\nStill other worlds, still other breeds of men,<br>\nAnd other generations of the wild.</p>\n<p>Hence too it happens in the sum there is<br>\nNo one thing single of its kind in birth,<br>\nAnd single and sole in growth, but rather it is<br>\nOne member of some generated race,<br>\nAmong full many others of like kind.<br>\nFirst, cast thy mind abroad upon the living:<br>\nThou’lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild<br>\nEven thus to be, and thus the scions of men<br>\nTo be begot, and lastly the mute flocks<br>\nOf scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.<br>\nWherefore confess we must on grounds the same<br>\nThat earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,<br>\nExist not sole and single—rather in number<br>\nExceeding number. Since that deeply set<br>\nOld boundary stone of life remains for them<br>\nNo less, and theirs a body of mortal birth<br>\nNo less, than every kind which here on earth<br>\nIs so abundant in its members found.</p>\n<p>Which well perceived if thou hold in mind,<br>\nThen Nature, delivered from every haughty lord,<br>\nAnd forthwith free, is seen to do all things<br>\nHerself and through herself of own accord,<br>\nRid of all gods. For—by their holy hearts<br>\nWhich pass in long tranquillity of peace<br>\nUntroubled ages and a serene life!—<br>\nWho hath the power (I ask), who hath the power<br>\nTo rule the sum of the immeasurable,<br>\nTo hold with steady hand the giant reins<br>\nOf the unfathomed deep? Who hath the power<br>\nAt once to roll a multitude of skies,<br>\nAt once to heat with fires ethereal all<br>\nThe fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds,<br>\nTo be at all times in all places near,<br>\nTo stablish darkness by his clouds, to shake<br>\nThe serene spaces of the sky with sound,<br>\nAnd hurl his lightnings,—ha, and whelm how oft<br>\nIn ruins his own temples, and to rave,<br>\nRetiring to the wildernesses, there<br>\nAt practice with that thunderbolt of his,<br>\nWhich yet how often shoots the guilty by,<br>\nAnd slays the honourable blameless ones!</p>\n<p>Ere since the birth-time of the world, ere since<br>\nThe risen first-born day of sea, earth, sun,<br>\nHave many germs been added from outside,<br>\nHave many seeds been added round about,<br>\nWhich the great All, the while it flung them on,<br>\nBrought hither, that from them the sea and lands<br>\nCould grow more big, and that the house of heaven<br>\nMight get more room and raise its lofty roofs<br>\nFar over earth, and air arise around.<br>\nFor bodies all, from out all regions, are<br>\nDivided by blows, each to its proper thing,<br>\nAnd all retire to their own proper kinds:<br>\nThe moist to moist retires; earth gets increase<br>\nFrom earthy body; and fires, as on a forge,<br>\nBeat out new fire; and ether forges ether;<br>\nTill nature, author and ender of the world,<br>\nHath led all things to extreme bound of growth:<br>\nAs haps when that which hath been poured inside<br>\nThe vital veins of life is now no more<br>\nThan that which ebbs within them and runs off.<br>\nThis is the point where life for each thing ends;<br>\nThis is the point where nature with her powers<br>\nCurbs all increase. For whatsoe’er thou seest<br>\nGrow big with glad increase, and step by step<br>\nClimb upward to ripe age, these to themselves<br>\nTake in more bodies than they send from selves,<br>\nWhilst still the food is easily infused<br>\nThrough all the veins, and whilst the things are not<br>\nSo far expanded that they cast away<br>\nSuch numerous atoms as to cause a waste<br>\nGreater than nutriment whereby they wax.<br>\nFor ‘tmust be granted, truly, that from things<br>\nMany a body ebbeth and runs off;<br>\nBut yet still more must come, until the things<br>\nHave touched development’s top pinnacle;<br>\nThen old age breaks their powers and ripe strength<br>\nAnd falls away into a worser part.<br>\nFor ever the ampler and more wide a thing,<br>\nAs soon as ever its augmentation ends,<br>\nIt scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round<br>\nMore bodies, sending them from out itself.<br>\nNor easily now is food disseminate<br>\nThrough all its veins; nor is that food enough<br>\nTo equal with a new supply on hand<br>\nThose plenteous exhalations it gives off.<br>\nThus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing<br>\nThey’re made less dense and when from blows without<br>\nThey are laid low; since food at last will fail<br>\nExtremest eld, and bodies from outside<br>\nCease not with thumping to undo a thing<br>\nAnd overmaster by infesting blows.</p>\n<p>Thus, too, the ramparts of the mighty world<br>\nOn all sides round shall taken be by storm,<br>\nAnd tumble to wrack and shivered fragments down.<br>\nFor food it is must keep things whole, renewing;<br>\n‘Tis food must prop and give support to all,—<br>\nBut to no purpose, since nor veins suffice<br>\nTo hold enough, nor nature ministers<br>\nAs much as needful. And even now ‘tis thus:<br>\nIts age is broken and the earth, outworn<br>\nWith many parturitions, scarce creates<br>\nThe little lives—she who created erst<br>\nAll generations and gave forth at birth<br>\nEnormous bodies of wild beasts of old.<br>\nFor never, I fancy, did a golden cord<br>\nFrom off the firmament above let down<br>\nThe mortal generations to the fields;<br>\nNor sea, nor breakers pounding on the rocks<br>\nCreated them; but earth it was who bore—<br>\nThe same to-day who feeds them from herself.<br>\nBesides, herself of own accord, she first<br>\nThe shining grains and vineyards of all joy<br>\nCreated for mortality; herself<br>\nGave the sweet fruitage and the pastures glad,<br>\nWhich now to-day yet scarcely wax in size,<br>\nEven when aided by our toiling arms.<br>\nWe break the ox, and wear away the strength<br>\nOf sturdy farm-hands; iron tools to-day<br>\nBarely avail for tilling of the fields,<br>\nSo niggardly they grudge our harvestings,<br>\nSo much increase our labour. Now to-day<br>\nThe aged ploughman, shaking of his head,<br>\nSighs o’er and o’er that labours of his hands<br>\nHave fallen out in vain, and, as he thinks<br>\nHow present times are not as times of old,<br>\nOften he praises the fortunes of his sire,<br>\nAnd crackles, prating, how the ancient race,<br>\nFulfilled with piety, supported life<br>\nWith simple comfort in a narrow plot,<br>\nSince, man for man, the measure of each field<br>\nWas smaller far i’ the old days. And, again,<br>\nThe gloomy planter of the withered vine<br>\nRails at the season’s change and wearies heaven,<br>\nNor grasps that all of things by sure degrees<br>\nAre wasting away and going to the tomb,<br>\nOutworn by venerable length of life.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/iii/proem/\">BOOK III - PROEM</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Once more, we all from seed celestial spring,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTo all is that same father, from whom earth,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe fostering mother, as she takes the drops"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods—"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd bears the human race and of the wild"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe generations all, the while she yields"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe foods wherewith all feed their frames and lead"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe genial life and propagate their kind;"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWherefore she owneth that maternal name,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBy old desert.
