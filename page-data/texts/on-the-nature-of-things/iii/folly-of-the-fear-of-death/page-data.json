But if indeed do feel<br>\nThe nature of mind and energy of soul,<br>\nAfter their severance from this body of ours,<br>\nYet nothing ‘tis to us who in the bonds<br>\nAnd wedlock of the soul and body live,<br>\nThrough which we’re fashioned to a single state.<br>\nAnd, even if time collected after death<br>\nThe matter of our frames and set it all<br>\nAgain in place as now, and if again<br>\nTo us the light of life were given, O yet<br>\nThat process too would not concern us aught,<br>\nWhen once the self-succession of our sense<br>\nHas been asunder broken. And now and here,<br>\nLittle enough we’re busied with the selves<br>\nWe were aforetime, nor, concerning them,<br>\nSuffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze<br>\nBackwards across all yesterdays of time<br>\nThe immeasurable, thinking how manifold<br>\nThe motions of matter are, then couldst thou well<br>\nCredit this too: often these very seeds<br>\n(From which we are to-day) of old were set<br>\nIn the same order as they are to-day—<br>\nYet this we can’t to consciousness recall<br>\nThrough the remembering mind. For there hath been<br>\nAn interposed pause of life, and wide<br>\nHave all the motions wandered everywhere<br>\nFrom these our senses. For if woe and ail<br>\nPerchance are toward, then the man to whom<br>\nThe bane can happen must himself be there<br>\nAt that same time. But death precludeth this,<br>\nForbidding life to him on whom might crowd<br>\nSuch irk and care; and granted ‘tis to know:<br>\nNothing for us there is to dread in death,<br>\nNo wretchedness for him who is no more,<br>\nThe same estate as if ne’er born before,<br>\nWhen death immortal hath ta’en the mortal life.</p>\n<p>Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because<br>\nWhen dead he rots with body laid away,<br>\nOr perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,<br>\nKnow well: he rings not true, and that beneath<br>\nStill works an unseen sting upon his heart,<br>\nHowever he deny that he believes.<br>\nHis shall be aught of feeling after death.<br>\nFor he, I fancy, grants not what he says,<br>\nNor what that presupposes, and he fails<br>\nTo pluck himself with all his roots from life<br>\nAnd cast that self away, quite unawares<br>\nFeigning that some remainder’s left behind.<br>\nFor when in life one pictures to oneself<br>\nHis body dead by beasts and vultures torn,<br>\nHe pities his state, dividing not himself<br>\nTherefrom, removing not the self enough<br>\nFrom the body flung away, imagining<br>\nHimself that body, and projecting there<br>\nHis own sense, as he stands beside it: hence<br>\nHe grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks<br>\nThat in true death there is no second self<br>\nAlive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,<br>\nOr stand lamenting that the self lies there<br>\nMangled or burning. For if it an evil is<br>\nDead to be jerked about by jaw and fang<br>\nOf the wild brutes, I see not why ‘twere not<br>\nBitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,<br>\nOr suffocate in honey, and, reclined<br>\nOn the smooth oblong of an icy slab,<br>\nGrow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth<br>\nDown-crushing from above.</p>\n<p>                         “Thee now no more<br>\nThe joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,<br>\nNor little sons run up to snatch their kisses<br>\nAnd touch with silent happiness thy heart.<br>\nThou shalt not speed in undertakings more,<br>\nNor be the warder of thine own no more.<br>\nPoor wretch,” they say, “one hostile hour hath ta’en<br>\nWretchedly from thee all life’s many guerdons,”<br>\nBut add not, “yet no longer unto thee<br>\nRemains a remnant of desire for them”<br>\nIf this they only well perceived with mind<br>\nAnd followed up with maxims, they would free<br>\nTheir state of man from anguish and from fear.<br>\n“O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,<br>\nSo shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,<br>\nReleased from every harrying pang. But we,<br>\nWe have bewept thee with insatiate woe,<br>\nStanding beside whilst on the awful pyre<br>\nThou wert made ashes; and no day shall take<br>\nFor us the eternal sorrow from the breast.”<br>\nBut ask the mourner what’s the bitterness<br>\nThat man should waste in an eternal grief,<br>\nIf, after all, the thing’s but sleep and rest?<br>\nFor when the soul and frame together are sunk<br>\nIn slumber, no one then demands his self<br>\nOr being. Well, this sleep may be forever,<br>\nWithout desire of any selfhood more,<br>\nFor all it matters unto us asleep.<br>\nYet not at all do those primordial germs<br>\nRoam round our members, at that time, afar<br>\nFrom their own motions that produce our senses—<br>\nSince, when he’s startled from his sleep, a man<br>\nCollects his senses. Death is, then, to us<br>\nMuch less—if there can be a less than that<br>\nWhich is itself a nothing: for there comes<br>\nHard upon death a scattering more great<br>\nOf the throng of matter, and no man wakes up<br>\nOn whom once falls the icy pause of life.</p>\n<p>This too, O often from the soul men say,<br>\nAlong their couches holding of the cups,<br>\nWith faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:<br>\n“Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,<br>\nSoon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,<br>\nIt may not be recalled.”—As if, forsooth,<br>\nIt were their prime of evils in great death<br>\nTo parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,<br>\nOr chafe for any lack.</p>\n<p>                     Once more, if Nature<br>\nShould of a sudden send a voice abroad,<br>\nAnd her own self inveigh against us so:<br>\n“Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern<br>\nThat thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?<br>\nWhy this bemoaning and beweeping death?<br>\nFor if thy life aforetime and behind<br>\nTo thee was grateful, and not all thy good<br>\nWas heaped as in sieve to flow away<br>\nAnd perish unavailingly, why not,<br>\nEven like a banqueter, depart the halls,<br>\nLaden with life? why not with mind content<br>\nTake now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?<br>\nBut if whatever thou enjoyed hath been<br>\nLavished and lost, and life is now offence,<br>\nWhy seekest more to add—which in its turn<br>\nWill perish foully and fall out in vain?<br>\nO why not rather make an end of life,<br>\nOf labour? For all I may devise or find<br>\nTo pleasure thee is nothing: all things are<br>\nThe same forever. Though not yet thy body<br>\nWrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts<br>\nOutworn, still things abide the same, even if<br>\nThou goest on to conquer all of time<br>\nWith length of days, yea, if thou never diest”—<br>\nWhat were our answer, but that Nature here<br>\nUrges just suit and in her words lays down<br>\nTrue cause of action? Yet should one complain,<br>\nRiper in years and elder, and lament,<br>\nPoor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,<br>\nThen would she not, with greater right, on him<br>\nCry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:<br>\n“Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!<br>\nThou wrinklest—after thou hast had the sum<br>\nOf the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever<br>\nWhat’s not at hand, contemning present good,<br>\nThat life has slipped away, unperfected<br>\nAnd unavailing unto thee. And now,<br>\nOr ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head<br>\nStands—and before thou canst be going home<br>\nSated and laden with the goodly feast.<br>\nBut now yield all that’s alien to thine age,—<br>\nUp, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must.”<br>\nJustly, I fancy, would she reason thus,<br>\nJustly inveigh and gird: since ever the old<br>\nOutcrowded by the new gives way, and ever<br>\nThe one thing from the others is repaired.<br>\nNor no man is consigned to the abyss<br>\nOf Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,<br>\nThat thus the after-generations grow,—<br>\nThough these, their life completed, follow thee;<br>\nAnd thus like thee are generations all—<br>\nAlready fallen, or some time to fall.<br>\nSo one thing from another rises ever;<br>\nAnd in fee-simple life is given to none,<br>\nBut unto all mere usufruct.</p>\n<p>                          Look back:<br>\nNothing to us was all fore-passed eld<br>\nOf time the eternal, ere we had a birth.<br>\nAnd Nature holds this like a mirror up<br>\nOf time-to-be when we are dead and gone.<br>\nAnd what is there so horrible appears?<br>\nNow what is there so sad about it all?<br>\nIs’t not serener far than any sleep?</p>\n<p>And, verily, those tortures said to be<br>\nIn Acheron, the deep, they all are ours<br>\nHere in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed<br>\nWith baseless terror, as the fables tell,<br>\nFears the huge boulder hanging in the air:<br>\nBut, rather, in life an empty dread of Gods<br>\nUrges mortality, and each one fears<br>\nSuch fall of fortune as may chance to him.<br>\nNor eat the vultures into Tityus<br>\nProstrate in Acheron, nor can they find,<br>\nForsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught<br>\nTo pry around for in that mighty breast.<br>\nHowever hugely he extend his bulk—<br>\nWho hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,<br>\nBut the whole earth—he shall not able be<br>\nTo bear eternal pain nor furnish food<br>\nFrom his own frame forever. But for us<br>\nA Tityus is he whom vultures rend<br>\nProstrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,<br>\nWhom troubles of any unappeased desires<br>\nAsunder rip. We have before our eyes<br>\nHere in this life also a Sisyphus<br>\nIn him who seeketh of the populace<br>\nThe rods, the axes fell, and evermore<br>\nRetires a beaten and a gloomy man.<br>\nFor to seek after power—an empty name,<br>\nNor given at all—and ever in the search<br>\nTo endure a world of toil, O this it is<br>\nTo shove with shoulder up the hill a stone<br>\nWhich yet comes rolling back from off the top,<br>\nAnd headlong makes for levels of the plain.<br>\nThen to be always feeding an ingrate mind,<br>\nFilling with good things, satisfying never—<br>\nAs do the seasons of the year for us,<br>\nWhen they return and bring their progenies<br>\nAnd varied charms, and we are never filled<br>\nWith the fruits of life—O this, I fancy, ‘tis<br>\nTo pour, like those young virgins in the tale,<br>\nWaters into a sieve, unfilled forever.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Cerberus and Furies, and that Lack of Light</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tartarus, out-belching from his mouth the surge<br>\nOf horrible heat—the which are nowhere, nor<br>\nIndeed can be: but in this life is fear<br>\nOf retributions just and expiations<br>\nFor evil acts: the dungeon and the leap<br>\nFrom that dread rock of infamy, the stripes,<br>\nThe executioners, the oaken rack,<br>\nThe iron plates, bitumen, and the torch.<br>\nAnd even though these are absent, yet the mind,<br>\nWith a fore-fearing conscience, plies its goads<br>\nAnd burns beneath the lash, nor sees meanwhile<br>\nWhat terminus of ills, what end of pine<br>\nCan ever be, and feareth lest the same<br>\nBut grow more heavy after death. Of truth,<br>\nThe life of fools is Acheron on earth.</p>\n<p>This also to thy very self sometimes<br>\nRepeat thou mayst: “Lo, even good Ancus left<br>\nThe sunshine with his eyes, in divers things<br>\nA better man than thou, O worthless hind;<br>\nAnd many other kings and lords of rule<br>\nThereafter have gone under, once who swayed<br>\nO’er mighty peoples. And he also, he—<br>\nWho whilom paved a highway down the sea,<br>\nAnd gave his legionaries thoroughfare<br>\nAlong the deep, and taught them how to cross<br>\nThe pools of brine afoot, and did contemn,<br>\nTrampling upon it with his cavalry,<br>\nThe bellowings of ocean—poured his soul<br>\nFrom dying body, as his light was ta’en.<br>\nAnd Scipio’s son, the thunderbolt of war,<br>\nHorror of Carthage, gave his bones to earth,<br>\nLike to the lowliest villein in the house.<br>\nAdd finders-out of sciences and arts;<br>\nAdd comrades of the Heliconian dames,<br>\nAmong whom Homer, sceptered o’er them all,<br>\nNow lies in slumber sunken with the rest.<br>\nThen, too, Democritus, when ripened eld<br>\nAdmonished him his memory waned away,<br>\nOf own accord offered his head to death.<br>\nEven Epicurus went, his light of life<br>\nRun out, the man in genius who o’er-topped<br>\nThe human race, extinguishing all others,<br>\nAs sun, in ether arisen, all the stars.<br>\nWilt thou, then, dally, thou complain to go?—<br>\nFor whom already life’s as good as dead,<br>\nWhilst yet thou livest and lookest?—who in sleep<br>\nWastest thy life—time’s major part, and snorest<br>\nEven when awake, and ceasest not to see<br>\nThe stuff of dreams, and bearest a mind beset<br>\nBy baseless terror, nor discoverest oft<br>\nWhat’s wrong with thee, when, like a sotted wretch,<br>\nThou’rt jostled along by many crowding cares,<br>\nAnd wanderest reeling round, with mind aswim.”</p>\n<p>If men, in that same way as on the mind<br>\nThey feel the load that wearies with its weight,<br>\nCould also know the causes whence it comes,<br>\nAnd why so great the heap of ill on heart,<br>\nO not in this sort would they live their life,<br>\nAs now so much we see them, knowing not<br>\nWhat ‘tis they want, and seeking ever and ever<br>\nA change of place, as if to drop the burden.<br>\nThe man who sickens of his home goes out,<br>\nForth from his splendid halls, and straight—returns,<br>\nFeeling i’faith no better off abroad.<br>\nHe races, driving his Gallic ponies along,<br>\nDown to his villa, madly,—as in haste<br>\nTo hurry help to a house afire.—At once<br>\nHe yawns, as soon as foot has touched the threshold,<br>\nOr drowsily goes off in sleep and seeks<br>\nForgetfulness, or maybe bustles about<br>\nAnd makes for town again. In such a way<br>\nEach human flees himself—a self in sooth,<br>\nAs happens, he by no means can escape;<br>\nAnd willy-nilly he cleaves to it and loathes,<br>\nSick, sick, and guessing not the cause of ail.<br>\nYet should he see but that, O chiefly then,<br>\nLeaving all else, he’d study to divine<br>\nThe nature of things, since here is in debate<br>\nEternal time and not the single hour,<br>\nMortal’s estate in whatsoever remains<br>\nAfter great death.</p>\n<p>              And too, when all is said,<br>\nWhat evil lust of life is this so great<br>\nSubdues us to live, so dreadfully distraught<br>\nIn perils and alarms? one fixed end<br>\nOf life abideth for mortality;<br>\nDeath’s not to shun, and we must go to meet.<br>\nBesides we’re busied with the same devices,<br>\nEver and ever, and we are at them ever,<br>\nAnd there’s no new delight that may be forged<br>\nBy living on. But whilst the thing we long for<br>\nIs lacking, that seems good above all else;<br>\nThereafter, when we’ve touched it, something else<br>\nWe long for; ever one equal thirst of life<br>\nGrips us agape. And doubtful ‘tis what fortune<br>\nThe future times may carry, or what be<br>\nThat chance may bring, or what the issue next<br>\nAwaiting us. Nor by prolonging life<br>\nTake we the least away from death’s own time,<br>\nNor can we pluck one moment off, whereby<br>\nTo minish the aeons of our state of death.<br>\nTherefore, O man, by living on, fulfil<br>\nAs many generations as thou may:<br>\nEternal death shall there be waiting still;<br>\nAnd he who died with light of yesterday<br>\nShall be no briefer time in death’s No-more<br>\nThan he who perished months or years before.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/iv/proem/\">BOOK IV - PROEM</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                     Therefore death to us"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIs nothing, nor concerns us in the least,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSince nature of mind is mortal evermore."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd just as in the ages gone before"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWe felt no touch of ill, when all sides round"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTo battle came the Carthaginian host,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd the times, shaken by tumultuous war,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nUnder the aery coasts of arching heaven"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nShuddered and trembled, and all humankind"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nDoubted to which the empery should fall"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBy land and sea, thus when we are no more,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhen comes that sundering of our body and soul"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThrough which we’re fashioned to a single state,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nVerily naught to us, us then no more,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nCan come to pass, naught move our senses then—"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNo, not if earth confounded were with sea,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd sea with heaven.
