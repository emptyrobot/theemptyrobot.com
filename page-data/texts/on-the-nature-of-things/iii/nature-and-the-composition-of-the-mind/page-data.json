[But some hold]<br>\nThat sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,<br>\nBut is of body some one vital state,—<br>\nNamed “harmony” by Greeks, because thereby<br>\nWe live with sense, though intellect be not<br>\nIn any part: as oft the body is said<br>\nTo have good health (when health, however, ‘s not<br>\nOne part of him who has it), so they place<br>\nThe sense of mind in no fixed part of man.<br>\nMightily, diversly, meseems they err.<br>\nOften the body palpable and seen<br>\nSickens, while yet in some invisible part<br>\nWe feel a pleasure; oft the other way,<br>\nA miserable in mind feels pleasure still<br>\nThroughout his body—quite the same as when<br>\nA foot may pain without a pain in head.<br>\nBesides, when these our limbs are given o’er<br>\nTo gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame<br>\nAt random void of sense, a something else<br>\nIs yet within us, which upon that time<br>\nBestirs itself in many a wise, receiving<br>\nAll motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.<br>\nNow, for to see that in man’s members dwells<br>\nAlso the soul, and body ne’er is wont<br>\nTo feel sensation by a “harmony”<br>\nTake this in chief: the fact that life remains<br>\nOft in our limbs, when much of body’s gone;<br>\nYet that same life, when particles of heat,<br>\nThough few, have scattered been, and through the mouth<br>\nAir has been given forth abroad, forthwith<br>\nForever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.<br>\nThus mayst thou know that not all particles<br>\nPerform like parts, nor in like manner all<br>\nAre props of weal and safety: rather those—<br>\nThe seeds of wind and exhalations warm—<br>\nTake care that in our members life remains.<br>\nTherefore a vital heat and wind there is<br>\nWithin the very body, which at death<br>\nDeserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind<br>\nAnd even of soul is found to be, as ‘twere,<br>\nA part of man, give over “harmony”—<br>\nName to musicians brought from Helicon,—<br>\nUnless themselves they filched it otherwise,<br>\nTo serve for what was lacking name till then.<br>\nWhate’er it be, they’re welcome to it—thou,<br>\nHearken my other maxims.</p>\n<p>                             Mind and soul,<br>\nI say, are held conjoined one with other,<br>\nAnd form one single nature of themselves;<br>\nBut chief and regnant through the frame entire<br>\nIs still that counsel which we call the mind,<br>\nAnd that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.<br>\nHere leap dismay and terror; round these haunts<br>\nBe blandishments of joys; and therefore here<br>\nThe intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,<br>\nThroughout the body scattered, but obeys—<br>\nMoved by the nod and motion of the mind.<br>\nThis, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;<br>\nThis for itself hath mirth, even when the thing<br>\nThat moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.<br>\nAnd as, when head or eye in us is smit<br>\nBy assailing pain, we are not tortured then<br>\nThrough all the body, so the mind alone<br>\nIs sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,<br>\nWhilst yet the soul’s remainder through the limbs<br>\nAnd through the frame is stirred by nothing new.<br>\nBut when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,<br>\nWe mark the whole soul suffering all at once<br>\nAlong man’s members: sweats and pallors spread<br>\nOver the body, and the tongue is broken,<br>\nAnd fails the voice away, and ring the ears,<br>\nMists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,—<br>\nAye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.<br>\nHence, whoso will can readily remark<br>\nThat soul conjoined is with mind, and, when<br>\n‘Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith<br>\nIn turn it hits and drives the body too.</p>\n<p>And this same argument establisheth<br>\nThat nature of mind and soul corporeal is:<br>\nFor when ‘tis seen to drive the members on,<br>\nTo snatch from sleep the body, and to change<br>\nThe countenance, and the whole state of man<br>\nTo rule and turn,—what yet could never be<br>\nSans contact, and sans body contact fails—<br>\nMust we not grant that mind and soul consist<br>\nOf a corporeal nature?—And besides<br>\nThou markst that likewise with this body of ours<br>\nSuffers the mind and with our body feels.<br>\nIf the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones<br>\nAnd bares the inner thews hits not the life,<br>\nYet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,<br>\nAnd, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,<br>\nAnd whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.<br>\nSo nature of mind must be corporeal, since<br>\nFrom stroke and spear corporeal ‘tis in throes.</p>\n<p>Now, of what body, what components formed<br>\nIs this same mind I will go on to tell.<br>\nFirst, I aver, ‘tis superfine, composed<br>\nOf tiniest particles—that such the fact<br>\nThou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:<br>\nNothing is seen to happen with such speed<br>\nAs what the mind proposes and begins;<br>\nTherefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly<br>\nThan aught whose nature’s palpable to eyes.<br>\nBut what’s so agile must of seeds consist<br>\nMost round, most tiny, that they may be moved,<br>\nWhen hit by impulse slight. So water moves,<br>\nIn waves along, at impulse just the least—<br>\nBeing create of little shapes that roll;<br>\nBut, contrariwise, the quality of honey<br>\nMore stable is, its liquids more inert,<br>\nMore tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter<br>\nCleaves more together, since, indeed, ‘tis made<br>\nOf atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.<br>\nFor the light breeze that hovers yet can blow<br>\nHigh heaps of poppy-seed away for thee<br>\nDownward from off the top; but, contrariwise,<br>\nA pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat<br>\nIt can’t at all. Thus, in so far as bodies<br>\nAre small and smooth, is their mobility;<br>\nBut, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,<br>\nThe more immovable they prove. Now, then,<br>\nSince nature of mind is movable so much,<br>\nConsist it must of seeds exceeding small<br>\nAnd smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,<br>\nGood friend, will serve thee opportune in else.<br>\nThis also shows the nature of the same,<br>\nHow nice its texture, in how small a space<br>\n‘Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:<br>\nWhen death’s unvexed repose gets hold on man<br>\nAnd mind and soul retire, thou markest there<br>\nFrom the whole body nothing ta’en in form,<br>\nNothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,<br>\nBut vital sense and exhalation hot.<br>\nThus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,<br>\nTwined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,<br>\nSeeing that, when ‘tis from whole body gone,<br>\nThe outward figuration of the limbs<br>\nIs unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.<br>\nJust so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,<br>\nOr when an unguent’s perfume delicate<br>\nInto the winds away departs, or when<br>\nFrom any body savour’s gone, yet still<br>\nThe thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,<br>\nThereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight—<br>\nNo marvel, because seeds many and minute<br>\nProduce the savours and the redolence<br>\nIn the whole body of the things. And so,<br>\nAgain, again, nature of mind and soul<br>\n‘Tis thine to know created is of seeds<br>\nThe tiniest ever, since at flying-forth<br>\nIt beareth nothing of the weight away.</p>\n<p>Yet fancy not its nature simple so.<br>\nFor an impalpable aura, mixed with heat,<br>\nDeserts the dying, and heat draws off the air;<br>\nAnd heat there’s none, unless commixed with air:<br>\nFor, since the nature of all heat is rare,<br>\nAthrough it many seeds of air must move.<br>\nThus nature of mind is triple; yet those all<br>\nSuffice not for creating sense—since mind<br>\nAccepteth not that aught of these can cause<br>\nSense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts<br>\nA man revolves in mind. So unto these<br>\nMust added be a somewhat, and a fourth;<br>\nThat somewhat’s altogether void of name;<br>\nThan which existeth naught more mobile, naught<br>\nMore an impalpable, of elements<br>\nMore small and smooth and round. That first transmits<br>\nSense-bearing motions through the frame, for that<br>\nIs roused the first, composed of little shapes;<br>\nThence heat and viewless force of wind take up<br>\nThe motions, and thence air, and thence all things<br>\nAre put in motion; the blood is strook, and then<br>\nThe vitals all begin to feel, and last<br>\nTo bones and marrow the sensation comes—<br>\nPleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught<br>\nEnter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through,<br>\nBut all things be perturbed to that degree<br>\nThat room for life will fail, and parts of soul<br>\nWill scatter through the body’s every pore.<br>\nYet as a rule, almost upon the skin<br>\nThese motion aIl are stopped, and this is why<br>\nWe have the power to retain our life.</p>\n<p>Now in my eagerness to tell thee how<br>\nThey are commixed, through what unions fit<br>\nThey function so, my country’s pauper-speech<br>\nConstrains me sadly. As I can, however,<br>\nI’ll touch some points and pass. In such a wise<br>\nCourse these primordials ‘mongst one another<br>\nWith inter-motions that no one can be<br>\nFrom other sundered, nor its agency<br>\nPerform, if once divided by a space;<br>\nLike many powers in one body they work.<br>\nAs in the flesh of any creature still<br>\nIs odour and savour and a certain warmth,<br>\nAnd yet from all of these one bulk of body<br>\nIs made complete, so, viewless force of wind<br>\nAnd warmth and air, commingled, do create<br>\nOne nature, by that mobile energy<br>\nAssisted which from out itself to them<br>\nImparts initial motion, whereby first<br>\nSense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.<br>\nFor lurks this essence far and deep and under,<br>\nNor in our body is aught more shut from view,<br>\nAnd ‘tis the very soul of all the soul.<br>\nAnd as within our members and whole frame<br>\nThe energy of mind and power of soul<br>\nIs mixed and latent, since create it is<br>\nOf bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth,<br>\nThis essence void of name, composed of small,<br>\nAnd seems the very soul of all the soul,<br>\nAnd holds dominion o’er the body all.<br>\nAnd by like reason wind and air and heat<br>\nMust function so, commingled through the frame,<br>\nAnd now the one subside and now another<br>\nIn interchange of dominance, that thus<br>\nFrom all of them one nature be produced,<br>\nLest heat and wind apart, and air apart,<br>\nMake sense to perish, by disseverment.<br>\nThere is indeed in mind that heat it gets<br>\nWhen seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes<br>\nMore swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind,<br>\nMuch, and so cold, companion of all dread,<br>\nWhich rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;<br>\nThere is no less that state of air composed,<br>\nMaking the tranquil breast, the serene face.<br>\nBut more of hot have they whose restive hearts,<br>\nWhose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage—<br>\nOf which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,<br>\nWho often with roaring burst the breast o’erwrought,<br>\nUnable to hold the surging wrath within;<br>\nBut the cold mind of stags has more of wind,<br>\nAnd speedier through their inwards rouses up<br>\nThe icy currents which make their members quake.<br>\nBut more the oxen live by tranquil air,<br>\nNor e’er doth smoky torch of wrath applied,<br>\nO’erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk,<br>\nRouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark,<br>\nPierced through by icy javelins of fear;<br>\nBut have their place half-way between the two—<br>\nStags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:<br>\nThough training make them equally refined,<br>\nIt leaves those pristine vestiges behind<br>\nOf each mind’s nature. Nor may we suppose<br>\nEvil can e’er be rooted up so far<br>\nThat one man’s not more given to fits of wrath,<br>\nAnother’s not more quickly touched by fear,<br>\nA third not more long-suffering than he should.<br>\nAnd needs must differ in many things besides<br>\nThe varied natures and resulting habits<br>\nOf humankind—of which not now can I<br>\nExpound the hidden causes, nor find names<br>\nEnough for all the divers shapes of those<br>\nPrimordials whence this variation springs.<br>\nBut this meseems I’m able to declare:<br>\nThose vestiges of natures left behind<br>\nWhich reason cannot quite expel from us<br>\nAre still so slight that naught prevents a man<br>\nFrom living a life even worthy of the gods.</p>\n<p>So then this soul is kept by all the body,<br>\nItself the body’s guard, and source of weal:<br>\nFor they with common roots cleave each to each,<br>\nNor can be torn asunder without death.<br>\nNot easy ‘tis from lumps of frankincense<br>\nTo tear their fragrance forth, without its nature<br>\nPerishing likewise: so, not easy ‘tis<br>\nFrom all the body nature of mind and soul<br>\nTo draw away, without the whole dissolved.<br>\nWith seeds so intertwined even from birth,<br>\nThey’re dowered conjointly with a partner-life;<br>\nNo energy of body or mind, apart,<br>\nEach of itself without the other’s power,<br>\nCan have sensation; but our sense, enkindled<br>\nAlong the vitals, to flame is blown by both<br>\nWith mutual motions. Besides the body alone<br>\nIs nor begot nor grows, nor after death<br>\nSeen to endure. For not as water at times<br>\nGives off the alien heat, nor is thereby<br>\nItself destroyed, but unimpaired remains—<br>\nNot thus, I say, can the deserted frame<br>\nBear the dissevering of its joined soul,<br>\nBut, rent and ruined, moulders all away.<br>\nThus the joint contact of the body and soul<br>\nLearns from their earliest age the vital motions,<br>\nEven when still buried in the mother’s womb;<br>\nSo no dissevering can hap to them,<br>\nWithout their bane and ill. And thence mayst see<br>\nThat, as conjoined is their source of weal,<br>\nConjoined also must their nature be.</p>\n<p>If one, moreover, denies that body feel,<br>\nAnd holds that soul, through all the body mixed,<br>\nTakes on this motion which we title “sense,”<br>\nHe battles in vain indubitable facts:<br>\nFor who’ll explain what body’s feeling is,<br>\nExcept by what the public fact itself<br>\nHas given and taught us?”But when soul is parted,<br>\nBody’s without all sense.” True!—loses what<br>\nWas even in its life-time not its own;<br>\nAnd much beside it loses, when soul’s driven<br>\nForth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes<br>\nThemselves can see no thing, but through the same<br>\nThe mind looks forth, as out of opened doors,<br>\nIs—a hard saying; since the feel in eyes<br>\nSays the reverse. For this itself draws on<br>\nAnd forces into the pupils of our eyes<br>\nOur consciousness. And note the case when often<br>\nWe lack the power to see refulgent things,<br>\nBecause our eyes are hampered by their light—<br>\nWith a mere doorway this would happen not;<br>\nFor, since it is our very selves that see,<br>\nNo open portals undertake the toil.<br>\nBesides, if eyes of ours but act as doors,<br>\nMethinks that, were our sight removed, the mind<br>\nOught then still better to behold a thing—<br>\nWhen even the door-posts have been cleared away.</p>\n<p>Herein in these affairs nowise take up<br>\nWhat honoured sage, Democritus, lays down—<br>\nThat proposition, that primordials<br>\nOf body and mind, each super-posed on each,<br>\nVary alternately and interweave<br>\nThe fabric of our members. For not only<br>\nAre the soul-elements smaller far than those<br>\nWhich this our body and inward parts compose,<br>\nBut also are they in their number less,<br>\nAnd scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus<br>\nThis canst thou guarantee: soul’s primal germs<br>\nMaintain between them intervals as large<br>\nAt least as are the smallest bodies, which,<br>\nWhen thrown against us, in our body rouse<br>\nSense-bearing motions. Hence it comes that we<br>\nSometimes don’t feel alighting on our frames<br>\nThe clinging dust, or chalk that settles soft;<br>\nNor mists of night, nor spider’s gossamer<br>\nWe feel against us, when, upon our road,<br>\nIts net entangles us, nor on our head<br>\nThe dropping of its withered garmentings;<br>\nNor bird-feathers, nor vegetable down,<br>\nFlying about, so light they barely fall;<br>\nNor feel the steps of every crawling thing,<br>\nNor each of all those footprints on our skin<br>\nOf midges and the like. To that degree<br>\nMust many primal germs be stirred in us<br>\nEre once the seeds of soul that through our frame<br>\nAre intermingled ‘gin to feel that those<br>\nPrimordials of the body have been strook,<br>\nAnd ere, in pounding with such gaps between,<br>\nThey clash, combine and leap apart in turn.</p>\n<p>But mind is more the keeper of the gates,<br>\nHath more dominion over life than soul.<br>\nFor without intellect and mind there’s not<br>\nOne part of soul can rest within our frame<br>\nLeast part of time; companioning, it goes<br>\nWith mind into the winds away, and leaves<br>\nThe icy members in the cold of death.<br>\nBut he whose mind and intellect abide<br>\nHimself abides in life. However much<br>\nThe trunk be mangled, with the limbs lopped off,<br>\nThe soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs,<br>\nStill lives the trunk and draws the vital air.<br>\nEven when deprived of all but all the soul,<br>\nYet will it linger on and cleave to life,—<br>\nJust as the power of vision still is strong,<br>\nIf but the pupil shall abide unharmed,<br>\nEven when the eye around it’s sorely rent—<br>\nProvided only thou destroyest not<br>\nWholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil,<br>\nLeavest that pupil by itself behind—<br>\nFor more would ruin sight. But if that centre,<br>\nThat tiny part of eye, be eaten through,<br>\nForthwith the vision fails and darkness comes,<br>\nThough in all else the unblemished ball be clear.<br>\n‘Tis by like compact that the soul and mind<br>\nAre each to other bound forevermore.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/iii/the-soul-is-mortal/\">BOOK III - THE SOUL IS MORTAL</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe intellect, wherein is seated life’s"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nCounsel and regimen, is part no less"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf man than hand and foot and eyes are parts"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf one whole breathing creature.
