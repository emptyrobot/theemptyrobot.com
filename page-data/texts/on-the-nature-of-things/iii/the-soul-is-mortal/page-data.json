Now, then, since thou seest,<br>\nTheir liquids depart, their waters flow away,<br>\nWhen jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke<br>\nDepart into the winds away, believe<br>\nThe soul no less is shed abroad and dies<br>\nMore quickly far, more quickly is dissolved<br>\nBack to its primal bodies, when withdrawn<br>\nFrom out man’s members it has gone away.<br>\nFor, sure, if body (container of the same<br>\nLike as a jar), when shivered from some cause,<br>\nAnd rarefied by loss of blood from veins,<br>\nCannot for longer hold the soul, how then<br>\nThinkst thou it can be held by any air—<br>\nA stuff much rarer than our bodies be?</p>\n<p>Besides we feel that mind to being comes<br>\nAlong with body, with body grows and ages.<br>\nFor just as children totter round about<br>\nWith frames infirm and tender, so there follows<br>\nA weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,<br>\nWhere years have ripened into robust powers,<br>\nCounsel is also greater, more increased<br>\nThe power of mind; thereafter, where already<br>\nThe body’s shattered by master-powers of eld,<br>\nAnd fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,<br>\nThought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way;<br>\nAll fails, all’s lacking at the selfsame time.<br>\nTherefore it suits that even the soul’s dissolved,<br>\nLike smoke, into the lofty winds of air;<br>\nSince we behold the same to being come<br>\nAlong with body and grow, and, as I’ve taught,<br>\nCrumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.</p>\n<p>Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes<br>\nMonstrous diseases and the dreadful pain,<br>\nSo mind its bitter cares, the grief, the fear;<br>\nWherefore it tallies that the mind no less<br>\nPartaker is of death; for pain and disease<br>\nAre both artificers of death,—as well<br>\nWe’ve learned by the passing of many a man ere now.<br>\nNay, too, in diseases of body, often the mind<br>\nWanders afield; for ‘tis beside itself,<br>\nAnd crazed it speaks, or many a time it sinks,<br>\nWith eyelids closing and a drooping nod,<br>\nIn heavy drowse, on to eternal sleep;<br>\nFrom whence nor hears it any voices more,<br>\nNor able is to know the faces here<br>\nOf those about him standing with wet cheeks<br>\nWho vainly call him back to light and life.<br>\nWherefore mind too, confess we must, dissolves,<br>\nSeeing, indeed, contagions of disease<br>\nEnter into the same. Again, O why,<br>\nWhen the strong wine has entered into man,<br>\nAnd its diffused fire gone round the veins,<br>\nWhy follows then a heaviness of limbs,<br>\nA tangle of the legs as round he reels,<br>\nA stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked,<br>\nEyes all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls,<br>\nAnd whatso else is of that ilk?—Why this?—<br>\nIf not that violent and impetuous wine<br>\nIs wont to confound the soul within the body?<br>\nBut whatso can confounded be and balked,<br>\nGives proof, that if a hardier cause got in,<br>\n‘Twould hap that it would perish then, bereaved<br>\nOf any life thereafter. And, moreover,<br>\nOften will some one in a sudden fit,<br>\nAs if by stroke of lightning, tumble down<br>\nBefore our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,<br>\nBlither, and twist about with sinews taut,<br>\nGasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs<br>\nWith tossing round. No marvel, since distract<br>\nThrough frame by violence of disease.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Confounds, he foams, as if to vomit soul,<br>\nAs on the salt sea boil the billows round<br>\nUnder the master might of winds. And now<br>\nA groan’s forced out, because his limbs are griped,<br>\nBut, in the main, because the seeds of voice<br>\nAre driven forth and carried in a mass<br>\nOutwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,<br>\nAnd have a builded highway. He becomes<br>\nMere fool, since energy of mind and soul<br>\nConfounded is, and, as I’ve shown, to-riven,<br>\nAsunder thrown, and torn to pieces all<br>\nBy the same venom. But, again, where cause<br>\nOf that disease has faced about, and back<br>\nRetreats sharp poison of corrupted frame<br>\nInto its shadowy lairs, the man at first<br>\nArises reeling, and gradually comes back<br>\nTo all his senses and recovers soul.<br>\nThus, since within the body itself of man<br>\nThe mind and soul are by such great diseases<br>\nShaken, so miserably in labour distraught,<br>\nWhy, then, believe that in the open air,<br>\nWithout a body, they can pass their life,<br>\nImmortal, battling with the master winds?<br>\nAnd, since we mark the mind itself is cured,<br>\nLike the sick body, and restored can be<br>\nBy medicine, this is forewarning too<br>\nThat mortal lives the mind. For proper it is<br>\nThat whosoe’er begins and undertakes<br>\nTo alter the mind, or meditates to change<br>\nAny another nature soever, should add<br>\nNew parts, or readjust the order given,<br>\nOr from the sum remove at least a bit.<br>\nBut what’s immortal willeth for itself<br>\nIts parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,<br>\nNor any bit soever flow away:<br>\nFor change of anything from out its bounds<br>\nMeans instant death of that which was before.<br>\nErgo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,<br>\nOr by the medicine restored, gives signs,<br>\nAs I have taught, of its mortality.<br>\nSo surely will a fact of truth make head<br>\n‘Gainst errors’ theories all, and so shut off<br>\nAll refuge from the adversary, and rout<br>\nError by two-edged confutation.</p>\n<p>And since the mind is of a man one part,<br>\nWhich in one fixed place remains, like ears,<br>\nAnd eyes, and every sense which pilots life;<br>\nAnd just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart,<br>\nSevered from us, can neither feel nor be,<br>\nBut in the least of time is left to rot,<br>\nThus mind alone can never be, without<br>\nThe body and the man himself, which seems,<br>\nAs ‘twere the vessel of the same—or aught<br>\nWhate’er thou’lt feign as yet more closely joined:<br>\nSince body cleaves to mind by surest bonds.</p>\n<p>Again, the body’s and the mind’s live powers<br>\nOnly in union prosper and enjoy;<br>\nFor neither can nature of mind, alone of self<br>\nSans body, give the vital motions forth;<br>\nNor, then, can body, wanting soul, endure<br>\nAnd use the senses. Verily, as the eye,<br>\nAlone, up-rended from its roots, apart<br>\nFrom all the body, can peer about at naught,<br>\nSo soul and mind it seems are nothing able,<br>\nWhen by themselves. No marvel, because, commixed<br>\nThrough veins and inwards, and through bones and thews,<br>\nTheir elements primordial are confined<br>\nBy all the body, and own no power free<br>\nTo bound around through interspaces big,<br>\nThus, shut within these confines, they take on<br>\nMotions of sense, which, after death, thrown out<br>\nBeyond the body to the winds of air,<br>\nTake on they cannot—and on this account,<br>\nBecause no more in such a way confined.<br>\nFor air will be a body, be alive,<br>\nIf in that air the soul can keep itself,<br>\nAnd in that air enclose those motions all<br>\nWhich in the thews and in the body itself<br>\nA while ago ‘twas making. So for this,<br>\nAgain, again, I say confess we must,<br>\nThat, when the body’s wrappings are unwound,<br>\nAnd when the vital breath is forced without,<br>\nThe soul, the senses of the mind dissolve,—<br>\nSince for the twain the cause and ground of life<br>\nIs in the fact of their conjoined estate.</p>\n<p>Once more, since body’s unable to sustain<br>\nDivision from the soul, without decay<br>\nAnd obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that<br>\nThe soul, uprisen from the body’s deeps,<br>\nHas filtered away, wide-drifted like a smoke,<br>\nOr that the changed body crumbling fell<br>\nWith ruin so entire, because, indeed,<br>\nIts deep foundations have been moved from place,<br>\nThe soul out-filtering even through the frame,<br>\nAnd through the body’s every winding way<br>\nAnd orifice? And so by many means<br>\nThou’rt free to learn that nature of the soul<br>\nHath passed in fragments out along the frame,<br>\nAnd that ‘twas shivered in the very body<br>\nEre ever it slipped abroad and swam away<br>\nInto the winds of air. For never a man<br>\nDying appears to feel the soul go forth<br>\nAs one sure whole from all his body at once,<br>\nNor first come up the throat and into mouth;<br>\nBut feels it failing in a certain spot,<br>\nEven as he knows the senses too dissolve<br>\nEach in its own location in the frame.<br>\nBut were this mind of ours immortal mind,<br>\nDying ‘twould scarce bewail a dissolution,<br>\nBut rather the going, the leaving of its coat,<br>\nLike to a snake. Wherefore, when once the body<br>\nHath passed away, admit we must that soul,<br>\nShivered in all that body, perished too.<br>\nNay, even when moving in the bounds of life,<br>\nOften the soul, now tottering from some cause,<br>\nCraves to go out, and from the frame entire<br>\nLoosened to be; the countenance becomes<br>\nFlaccid, as if the supreme hour were there;<br>\nAnd flabbily collapse the members all<br>\nAgainst the bloodless trunk—the kind of case<br>\nWe see when we remark in common phrase,<br>\n“That man’s quite gone,” or “fainted dead away”;<br>\nAnd where there’s now a bustle of alarm,<br>\nAnd all are eager to get some hold upon<br>\nThe man’s last link of life. For then the mind<br>\nAnd all the power of soul are shook so sore,<br>\nAnd these so totter along with all the frame,<br>\nThat any cause a little stronger might<br>\nDissolve them altogether.—Why, then, doubt<br>\nThat soul, when once without the body thrust,<br>\nThere in the open, an enfeebled thing,<br>\nIts wrappings stripped away, cannot endure<br>\nNot only through no everlasting age,<br>\nBut even, indeed, through not the least of time?</p>\n<p>Then, too, why never is the intellect,<br>\nThe counselling mind, begotten in the head,<br>\nThe feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still<br>\nTo one sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast,<br>\nIf not that fixed places be assigned<br>\nFor each thing’s birth, where each, when ‘tis create,<br>\nIs able to endure, and that our frames<br>\nHave such complex adjustments that no shift<br>\nIn order of our members may appear?<br>\nTo that degree effect succeeds to cause,<br>\nNor is the flame once wont to be create<br>\nIn flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire.</p>\n<p>Besides, if nature of soul immortal be,<br>\nAnd able to feel, when from our frame disjoined,<br>\nThe same, I fancy, must be thought to be<br>\nEndowed with senses five,—nor is there way<br>\nBut this whereby to image to ourselves<br>\nHow under-souls may roam in Acheron.<br>\nThus painters and the elder race of bards<br>\nHave pictured souls with senses so endowed.<br>\nBut neither eyes, nor nose, nor hand, alone<br>\nApart from body can exist for soul,<br>\nNor tongue nor ears apart. And hence indeed<br>\nAlone by self they can nor feel nor be.</p>\n<p>And since we mark the vital sense to be<br>\nIn the whole body, all one living thing,<br>\nIf of a sudden a force with rapid stroke<br>\nShould slice it down the middle and cleave in twain,<br>\nBeyond a doubt likewise the soul itself,<br>\nDivided, dissevered, asunder will be flung<br>\nAlong with body. But what severed is<br>\nAnd into sundry parts divides, indeed<br>\nAdmits it owns no everlasting nature.<br>\nWe hear how chariots of war, areek<br>\nWith hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes<br>\nThe limbs away so suddenly that there,<br>\nFallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth,<br>\nThe while the mind and powers of the man<br>\nCan feel no pain, for swiftness of his hurt,<br>\nAnd sheer abandon in the zest of battle:<br>\nWith the remainder of his frame he seeks<br>\nAnew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks<br>\nHow the swift wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged<br>\nOff with the horses his left arm and shield;<br>\nNor other how his right has dropped away,<br>\nMounting again and on. A third attempts<br>\nWith leg dismembered to arise and stand,<br>\nWhilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot<br>\nTwitches its spreading toes. And even the head,<br>\nWhen from the warm and living trunk lopped off,<br>\nKeeps on the ground the vital countenance<br>\nAnd open eyes, until ‘t has rendered up<br>\nAll remnants of the soul. Nay, once again:<br>\nIf, when a serpent’s darting forth its tongue,<br>\nAnd lashing its tail, thou gettest chance to hew<br>\nWith axe its length of trunk to many parts,<br>\nThou’lt see each severed fragment writhing round<br>\nWith its fresh wound, and spattering up the sod,<br>\nAnd there the fore-part seeking with the jaws<br>\nAfter the hinder, with bite to stop the pain.<br>\nSo shall we say that these be souls entire<br>\nIn all those fractions?—but from that ‘twould follow<br>\nOne creature’d have in body many souls.<br>\nTherefore, the soul, which was indeed but one,<br>\nHas been divided with the body too:<br>\nEach is but mortal, since alike is each<br>\nHewn into many parts. Again, how often<br>\nWe view our fellow going by degrees,<br>\nAnd losing limb by limb the vital sense;<br>\nFirst nails and fingers of the feet turn blue,<br>\nNext die the feet and legs, then o’er the rest<br>\nSlow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death.<br>\nAnd since this nature of the soul is torn,<br>\nNor mounts away, as at one time, entire,<br>\nWe needs must hold it mortal. But perchance<br>\nIf thou supposest that the soul itself<br>\nCan inward draw along the frame, and bring<br>\nIts parts together to one place, and so<br>\nFrom all the members draw the sense away,<br>\nWhy, then, that place in which such stock of soul<br>\nCollected is, should greater seem in sense.<br>\nBut since such place is nowhere, for a fact,<br>\nAs said before, ‘tis rent and scattered forth,<br>\nAnd so goes under. Or again, if now<br>\nI please to grant the false, and say that soul<br>\nCan thus be lumped within the frames of those<br>\nWho leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit,<br>\nStill must the soul as mortal be confessed;<br>\nNor aught it matters whether to wrack it go,<br>\nDispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass<br>\nFrom all its parts, sink down to brutish death,<br>\nSince more and more in every region sense<br>\nFails the whole man, and less and less of life<br>\nIn every region lingers.</p>\n<p>                      And besides,<br>\nIf soul immortal is, and winds its way<br>\nInto the body at the birth of man,<br>\nWhy can we not remember something, then,<br>\nOf life-time spent before? why keep we not<br>\nSome footprints of the things we did of, old?<br>\nBut if so changed hath been the power of mind,<br>\nThat every recollection of things done<br>\nIs fallen away, at no o’erlong remove<br>\nIs that, I trow, from what we mean by death.<br>\nWherefore ‘tis sure that what hath been before<br>\nHath died, and what now is is now create.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if after the body hath been built<br>\nOur mind’s live powers are wont to be put in,<br>\nJust at the moment that we come to birth,<br>\nAnd cross the sills of life, ‘twould scarcely fit<br>\nFor them to live as if they seemed to grow<br>\nAlong with limbs and frame, even in the blood,<br>\nBut rather as in a cavern all alone.<br>\n(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)<br>\nBut public fact declares against all this:<br>\nFor soul is so entwined through the veins,<br>\nThe flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth<br>\nShare in sensation, as proven by dull ache,<br>\nBy twinge from icy water, or grating crunch<br>\nUpon a stone that got in mouth with bread.<br>\nWherefore, again, again, souls must be thought<br>\nNor void of birth, nor free from law of death;<br>\nNor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,<br>\nCould they be thought as able so to cleave<br>\nTo these our frames, nor, since so interwove,<br>\nAppears it that they’re able to go forth<br>\nUnhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed<br>\nFrom all the thews, articulations, bones.<br>\nBut, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,<br>\nFrom outward winding in its way, is wont<br>\nTo seep and soak along these members ours,<br>\nThen all the more ‘twill perish, being thus<br>\nWith body fused—for what will seep and soak<br>\nWill be dissolved and will therefore die.<br>\nFor just as food, dispersed through all the pores<br>\nOf body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,<br>\nPerishes, supplying from itself the stuff<br>\nFor other nature, thus the soul and mind,<br>\nThough whole and new into a body going,<br>\nAre yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,<br>\nWhilst, as through pores, to all the frame there pass<br>\nThose particles from which created is<br>\nThis nature of mind, now ruler of our body,<br>\nBorn from that soul which perished, when divided<br>\nAlong the frame. Wherefore it seems that soul<br>\nHath both a natal and funeral hour.</p>\n<p>Besides are seeds of soul there left behind<br>\nIn the breathless body, or not? If there they are,<br>\nIt cannot justly be immortal deemed,<br>\nSince, shorn of some parts lost, ‘thas gone away:<br>\nBut if, borne off with members uncorrupt,<br>\n‘Thas fled so absolutely all away<br>\nIt leaves not one remainder of itself<br>\nBehind in body, whence do cadavers, then,<br>\nFrom out their putrid flesh exhale the worms,<br>\nAnd whence does such a mass of living things,<br>\nBoneless and bloodless, o’er the bloated frame<br>\nBubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest<br>\nThat souls from outward into worms can wind,<br>\nAnd each into a separate body come,<br>\nAnd reckonest not why many thousand souls<br>\nCollect where only one has gone away,<br>\nHere is a point, in sooth, that seems to need<br>\nInquiry and a putting to the test:<br>\nWhether the souls go on a hunt for seeds<br>\nOf worms wherewith to build their dwelling places,<br>\nOr enter bodies ready-made, as ‘twere.<br>\nBut why themselves they thus should do and toil<br>\n‘Tis hard to say, since, being free of body,<br>\nThey flit around, harassed by no disease,<br>\nNor cold nor famine; for the body labours<br>\nBy more of kinship to these flaws of life,<br>\nAnd mind by contact with that body suffers<br>\nSo many ills. But grant it be for them<br>\nHowever useful to construct a body<br>\nTo which to enter in, ‘tis plain they can’t.<br>\nThen, souls for self no frames nor bodies make,<br>\nNor is there how they once might enter in<br>\nTo bodies ready-made—for they cannot<br>\nBe nicely interwoven with the same,<br>\nAnd there’ll be formed no interplay of sense<br>\nCommon to each.</p>\n<p>                Again, why is’t there goes<br>\nImpetuous rage with lion’s breed morose,<br>\nAnd cunning with foxes, and to deer why given<br>\nThe ancestral fear and tendency to flee,<br>\nAnd why in short do all the rest of traits<br>\nEngender from the very start of life<br>\nIn the members and mentality, if not<br>\nBecause one certain power of mind that came<br>\nFrom its own seed and breed waxes the same<br>\nAlong with all the body? But were mind<br>\nImmortal, were it wont to change its bodies,<br>\nHow topsy-turvy would earth’s creatures act!<br>\nThe Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft<br>\nOf antlered stag, the scurrying hawk would quake<br>\nAlong the winds of air at the coming dove,<br>\nAnd men would dote, and savage beasts be wise;<br>\nFor false the reasoning of those that say<br>\nImmortal mind is changed by change of body—<br>\nFor what is changed dissolves, and therefore dies.<br>\nFor parts are re-disposed and leave their order;<br>\nWherefore they must be also capable<br>\nOf dissolution through the frame at last,<br>\nThat they along with body perish all.<br>\nBut should some say that always souls of men<br>\nGo into human bodies, I will ask:<br>\nHow can a wise become a dullard soul?<br>\nAnd why is never a child’s a prudent soul?<br>\nAnd the mare’s filly why not trained so well<br>\nAs sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure<br>\nThey’ll take their refuge in the thought that mind<br>\nBecomes a weakling in a weakling frame.<br>\nYet be this so, ‘tis needful to confess<br>\nThe soul but mortal, since, so altered now<br>\nThroughout the frame, it loses the life and sense<br>\nIt had before. Or how can mind wax strong<br>\nCoequally with body and attain<br>\nThe craved flower of life, unless it be<br>\nThe body’s colleague in its origins?<br>\nOr what’s the purport of its going forth<br>\nFrom aged limbs?—fears it, perhaps, to stay,<br>\nPent in a crumbled body? Or lest its house,<br>\nOutworn by venerable length of days,<br>\nMay topple down upon it? But indeed<br>\nFor an immortal perils are there none.</p>\n<p>Again, at parturitions of the wild<br>\nAnd at the rites of Love, that souls should stand<br>\nReady hard by seems ludicrous enough—<br>\nImmortals waiting for their mortal limbs<br>\nIn numbers innumerable, contending madly<br>\nWhich shall be first and chief to enter in!—<br>\nUnless perchance among the souls there be<br>\nSuch treaties stablished that the first to come<br>\nFlying along, shall enter in the first,<br>\nAnd that they make no rivalries of strength!</p>\n<p>Again, in ether can’t exist a tree,<br>\nNor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields<br>\nCan fishes live, nor blood in timber be,<br>\nNor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged<br>\nWhere everything may grow and have its place.<br>\nThus nature of mind cannot arise alone<br>\nWithout the body, nor exist afar<br>\nFrom thews and blood.
