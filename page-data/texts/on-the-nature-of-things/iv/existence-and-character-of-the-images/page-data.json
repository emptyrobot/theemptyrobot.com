And commonly<br>\nThe awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,<br>\nStretched overhead in mighty theatres,<br>\nUpon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,<br>\nHave such an action quite; for there they dye<br>\nAnd make to undulate with their every hue<br>\nThe circled throng below, and all the stage,<br>\nAnd rich attire in the patrician seats.<br>\nAnd ever the more the theatre’s dark walls<br>\nAround them shut, the more all things within<br>\nLaugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,<br>\nThe daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since<br>\nThe canvas hangings thus discharge their dye<br>\nFrom off their surface, things in general must<br>\nLikewise their tenuous effigies discharge,<br>\nBecause in either case they are off-thrown<br>\nFrom off the surface. So there are indeed<br>\nSuch certain prints and vestiges of forms<br>\nWhich flit around, of subtlest texture made,<br>\nInvisible, when separate, each and one.<br>\nAgain, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such<br>\nStreams out of things diffusedly, because,<br>\nWhilst coming from the deeps of body forth<br>\nAnd rising out, along their bending path<br>\nThey’re torn asunder, nor have gateways straight<br>\nWherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.<br>\nBut contrariwise, when such a tenuous film<br>\nOf outside colour is thrown off, there’s naught<br>\nCan rend it, since ‘tis placed along the front<br>\nReady to hand. Lastly those images<br>\nWhich to our eyes in mirrors do appear,<br>\nIn water, or in any shining surface,<br>\nMust be, since furnished with like look of things,<br>\nFashioned from images of things sent out.<br>\nThere are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,<br>\nLike unto them, which no one can divine<br>\nWhen taken singly, which do yet give back,<br>\nWhen by continued and recurrent discharge<br>\nExpelled, a picture from the mirrors’ plane.<br>\nNor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept<br>\nSo well conserved that thus be given back<br>\nFigures so like each object.</p>\n<p>                       Now then, learn<br>\nHow tenuous is the nature of an image.<br>\nAnd in the first place, since primordials be<br>\nSo far beneath our senses, and much less<br>\nE’en than those objects which begin to grow<br>\nToo small for eyes to note, learn now in few<br>\nHow nice are the beginnings of all things—<br>\nThat this, too, I may yet confirm in proof:<br>\nFirst, living creatures are sometimes so small<br>\nThat even their third part can nowise be seen;<br>\nJudge, then, the size of any inward organ—<br>\nWhat of their sphered heart, their eyes, their limbs,<br>\nThe skeleton?—How tiny thus they are!<br>\nAnd what besides of those first particles<br>\nWhence soul and mind must fashioned be?—Seest not<br>\nHow nice and how minute? Besides, whatever<br>\nExhales from out its body a sharp smell—<br>\nThe nauseous absinth, or the panacea,<br>\nStrong southernwood, or bitter centaury—<br>\nIf never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain<br>\nPerchance [thou touch] a one of them</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Then why not rather know that images<br>\nFlit hither and thither, many, in many modes,<br>\nBodiless and invisible?</p>\n<p>                                But lest<br>\nHaply thou holdest that those images<br>\nWhich come from objects are the sole that flit,<br>\nOthers indeed there be of own accord<br>\nBegot, self-formed in earth’s aery skies,<br>\nWhich, moulded to innumerable shapes,<br>\nAre borne aloft, and, fluid as they are,<br>\nCease not to change appearance and to turn<br>\nInto new outlines of all sorts of forms;<br>\nAs we behold the clouds grow thick on high<br>\nAnd smirch the serene vision of the world,<br>\nStroking the air with motions. For oft are seen<br>\nThe giants’ faces flying far along<br>\nAnd trailing a spread of shadow; and at times<br>\nThe mighty mountains and mountain-sundered rocks<br>\nGoing before and crossing on the sun,<br>\nWhereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain<br>\nAnd leading in the other thunderheads.<br>\nNow [hear] how easy and how swift they be<br>\nEngendered, and perpetually flow off<br>\nFrom things and gliding pass away…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For ever every outside streams away<br>\nFrom off all objects, since discharge they may;<br>\nAnd when this outside reaches other things,<br>\nAs chiefly glass, it passes through; but where<br>\nIt reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood,<br>\nThere ‘tis so rent that it cannot give back<br>\nAn image. But when gleaming objects dense,<br>\nAs chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,<br>\nNothing of this sort happens. For it can’t<br>\nGo, as through glass, nor yet be rent—its safety,<br>\nBy virtue of that smoothness, being sure.<br>\n‘Tis therefore that from them the images<br>\nStream back to us; and howso suddenly<br>\nThou place, at any instant, anything<br>\nBefore a mirror, there an image shows;<br>\nProving that ever from a body’s surface<br>\nFlow off thin textures and thin shapes of things.<br>\nThus many images in little time<br>\nAre gendered; so their origin is named<br>\nRightly a speedy. And even as the sun<br>\nMust send below, in little time, to earth<br>\nSo many beams to keep all things so full<br>\nOf light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,<br>\nFrom things there must be borne, in many modes,<br>\nTo every quarter round, upon the moment,<br>\nThe many images of things; because<br>\nUnto whatever face of things we turn<br>\nThe mirror, things of form and hue the same<br>\nRespond. Besides, though but a moment since<br>\nSerenest was the weather of the sky,<br>\nSo fiercely sudden is it foully thick<br>\nThat ye might think that round about all murk<br>\nHad parted forth from Acheron and filled<br>\nThe mighty vaults of sky—so grievously,<br>\nAs gathers thus the storm-clouds’ gruesome night,<br>\nDo faces of black horror hang on high—<br>\nOf which how small a part an image is<br>\nThere’s none to tell or reckon out in words.</p>\n<p>Now come; with what swift motion they are borne,<br>\nThese images, and what the speed assigned<br>\nTo them across the breezes swimming on—<br>\nSo that o’er lengths of space a little hour<br>\nAlone is wasted, toward whatever region<br>\nEach with its divers impulse tends—I’ll tell<br>\nIn verses sweeter than they many are;<br>\nEven as the swan’s slight note is better far<br>\nThan that dispersed clamour of the cranes<br>\nAmong the southwind’s aery clouds. And first,<br>\nOne oft may see that objects which are light<br>\nAnd made of tiny bodies are the swift;<br>\nIn which class is the sun’s light and his heat,<br>\nSince made from small primordial elements<br>\nWhich, as it were, are forward knocked along<br>\nAnd through the interspaces of the air<br>\nTo pass delay not, urged by blows behind;<br>\nFor light by light is instantly supplied<br>\nAnd gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven.<br>\nThus likewise must the images have power<br>\nThrough unimaginable space to speed<br>\nWithin a point of time,—first, since a cause<br>\nExceeding small there is, which at their back<br>\nFar forward drives them and propels, where, too,<br>\nThey’re carried with such winged lightness on;<br>\nAnd, secondly, since furnished, when sent off,<br>\nWith texture of such rareness that they can<br>\nThrough objects whatsoever penetrate<br>\nAnd ooze, as ‘twere, through intervening air.<br>\nBesides, if those fine particles of things<br>\nWhich from so deep within are sent abroad,<br>\nAs light and heat of sun, are seen to glide<br>\nAnd spread themselves through all the space of heaven<br>\nUpon one instant of the day, and fly<br>\nO’er sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then<br>\nOf those which on the outside stand prepared,<br>\nWhen they’re hurled off with not a thing to check<br>\nTheir going out? Dost thou not see indeed<br>\nHow swifter and how farther must they go<br>\nAnd speed through manifold the length of space<br>\nIn time the same that from the sun the rays<br>\nO’erspread the heaven? This also seems to be<br>\nExample chief and true with what swift speed<br>\nThe images of things are borne about:<br>\nThat soon as ever under open skies<br>\nIs spread the shining water, all at once,<br>\nIf stars be out in heaven, upgleam from earth,<br>\nSerene and radiant in the water there,<br>\nThe constellations of the universe—<br>\nNow seest thou not in what a point of time<br>\nAn image from the shores of ether falls<br>\nUnto the shores of earth? Wherefore, again,<br>\nAnd yet again, ‘tis needful to confess<br>\nWith wondrous…</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a
