All such interpretation<br>\nIs aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,<br>\nSince naught is born in body so that we<br>\nMay use the same, but birth engenders use:<br>\nNo seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,<br>\nNo speaking ere the tongue created was;<br>\nBut origin of tongue came long before<br>\nDiscourse of words, and ears created were<br>\nMuch earlier than any sound was heard;<br>\nAnd all the members, so meseems, were there<br>\nBefore they got their use: and therefore, they<br>\nCould not be gendered for the sake of use.<br>\nBut contrariwise, contending in the fight<br>\nWith hand to hand, and rending of the joints,<br>\nAnd fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,<br>\nO long before the gleaming spears ere flew;<br>\nAnd nature prompted man to shun a wound,<br>\nBefore the left arm by the aid of art<br>\nOpposed the shielding targe. And, verily,<br>\nYielding the weary body to repose,<br>\nFar ancienter than cushions of soft beds,<br>\nAnd quenching thirst is earlier than cups.<br>\nThese objects, therefore, which for use and life<br>\nHave been devised, can be conceived as found<br>\nFor sake of using. But apart from such<br>\nAre all which first were born and afterwards<br>\nGave knowledge of their own utility—<br>\nChief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:<br>\nWherefore, again, ‘tis quite beyond thy power<br>\nTo hold that these could thus have been create<br>\nFor office of utility.</p>\n<p>                     Likewise,<br>\n‘Tis nothing strange that all the breathing creatures<br>\nSeek, even by nature of their frame, their food.<br>\nYes, since I’ve taught thee that from off the things<br>\nStream and depart innumerable bodies<br>\nIn modes innumerable too; but most<br>\nMust be the bodies streaming from the living—<br>\nWhich bodies, vexed by motion evermore,<br>\nAre through the mouth exhaled innumerable,<br>\nWhen weary creatures pant, or through the sweat<br>\nSqueezed forth innumerable from deep within.<br>\nThus body rarefies, so undermined<br>\nIn all its nature, and pain attends its state.<br>\nAnd so the food is taken to underprop<br>\nThe tottering joints, and by its interfusion<br>\nTo re-create their powers, and there stop up<br>\nThe longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,<br>\nFor eating. And the moist no less departs<br>\nInto all regions that demand the moist;<br>\nAnd many heaped-up particles of hot,<br>\nWhich cause such burnings in these bellies of ours,<br>\nThe liquid on arriving dissipates<br>\nAnd quenches like a fire, that parching heat<br>\nNo longer now can scorch the frame. And so,<br>\nThou seest how panting thirst is washed away<br>\nFrom off our body, how the hunger-pang<br>\nIt, too, appeased.</p>\n<p>                  Now, how it comes that we,<br>\nWhene’er we wish, can step with strides ahead,<br>\nAnd how ‘tis given to move our limbs about,<br>\nAnd what device is wont to push ahead<br>\nThis the big load of our corporeal frame,<br>\nI’ll say to thee—do thou attend what’s said.<br>\nI say that first some idol-films of walking<br>\nInto our mind do fall and smite the mind,<br>\nAs said before. Thereafter will arises;<br>\nFor no one starts to do a thing, before<br>\nThe intellect previsions what it wills;<br>\nAnd what it there pre-visioneth depends<br>\nOn what that image is. When, therefore, mind<br>\nDoth so bestir itself that it doth will<br>\nTo go and step along, it strikes at once<br>\nThat energy of soul that’s sown about<br>\nIn all the body through the limbs and frame—<br>\nAnd this is easy of performance, since<br>\nThe soul is close conjoined with the mind.<br>\nNext, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees<br>\nThus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.<br>\nThen too the body rarefies, and air,<br>\nForsooth as ever of such nimbleness,<br>\nComes on and penetrates aboundingly<br>\nThrough opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round<br>\nUnto all smallest places in our frame.<br>\nThus then by these twain factors, severally,<br>\nBody is borne like ship with oars and wind.<br>\nNor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder<br>\nThat particles so fine can whirl around<br>\nSo great a body and turn this weight of ours;<br>\nFor wind, so tenuous with its subtle body,<br>\nYet pushes, driving on the mighty ship<br>\nOf mighty bulk; one hand directs the same,<br>\nWhatever its momentum, and one helm<br>\nWhirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,<br>\nMany and huge, are moved and hoisted high<br>\nBy enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels,<br>\nWith but light strain.</p>\n<p>                 Now, by what modes this sleep<br>\nPours through our members waters of repose<br>\nAnd frees the breast from cares of mind, I’ll tell<br>\nIn verses sweeter than they many are;<br>\nEven as the swan’s slight note is better far<br>\nThan that dispersed clamour of the cranes<br>\nAmong the southwind’s aery clouds. Do thou<br>\nGive me sharp ears and a sagacious mind,—<br>\nThat thou mayst not deny the things to be<br>\nWhereof I’m speaking, nor depart away<br>\nWith bosom scorning these the spoken truths,<br>\nThyself at fault unable to perceive.<br>\nSleep chiefly comes when energy of soul<br>\nHath now been scattered through the frame, and part<br>\nExpelled abroad and gone away, and part<br>\nCrammed back and settling deep within the frame—<br>\nWhereafter then our loosened members droop.<br>\nFor doubt is none that by the work of soul<br>\nExist in us this sense, and when by slumber<br>\nThat sense is thwarted, we are bound to think<br>\nThe soul confounded and expelled abroad—<br>\nYet not entirely, else the frame would lie<br>\nDrenched in the everlasting cold of death.<br>\nIn sooth, where no one part of soul remained<br>\nLurking among the members, even as fire<br>\nLurks buried under many ashes, whence<br>\nCould sense amain rekindled be in members,<br>\nAs flame can rise anew from unseen fire?</p>\n<p>By what devices this strange state and new<br>\nMay be occasioned, and by what the soul<br>\nCan be confounded and the frame grow faint,<br>\nI will untangle: see to it, thou, that I<br>\nPour forth my words not unto empty winds.<br>\nIn first place, body on its outer parts—<br>\nSince these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts—<br>\nMust there be thumped and strook by blows of air<br>\nRepeatedly. And therefore almost all<br>\nAre covered either with hides, or else with shells,<br>\nOr with the horny callus, or with bark.<br>\nYet this same air lashes their inner parts,<br>\nWhen creatures draw a breath or blow it out.<br>\nWherefore, since body thus is flogged alike<br>\nUpon the inside and the out, and blows<br>\nCome in upon us through the little pores<br>\nEven inward to our body’s primal parts<br>\nAnd primal elements, there comes to pass<br>\nBy slow degrees, along our members then,<br>\nA kind of overthrow; for then confounded<br>\nAre those arrangements of the primal germs<br>\nOf body and of mind. It comes to pass<br>\nThat next a part of soul’s expelled abroad,<br>\nA part retreateth in recesses hid,<br>\nA part, too, scattered all about the frame,<br>\nCannot become united nor engage<br>\nIn interchange of motion. Nature now<br>\nSo hedges off approaches and the paths;<br>\nAnd thus the sense, its motions all deranged,<br>\nRetires down deep within; and since there’s naught,<br>\nAs ‘twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,<br>\nAnd all the members languish, and the arms<br>\nAnd eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,<br>\nEven there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.<br>\nAgain, sleep follows after food, because<br>\nThe food produces same result as air,<br>\nWhilst being scattered round through all the veins;<br>\nAnd much the heaviest is that slumber which,<br>\nFull or fatigued, thou takest; since ‘tis then<br>\nThat the most bodies disarrange themselves,<br>\nBruised by labours hard. And in same wise,<br>\nThis three-fold change: a forcing of the soul<br>\nDown deeper, more a casting-forth of it,<br>\nA moving more divided in its parts<br>\nAnd scattered more.</p>\n<p>                   And to whate’er pursuit<br>\nA man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs<br>\nOn which we theretofore have tarried much,<br>\nAnd mind hath strained upon the more, we seem<br>\nIn sleep not rarely to go at the same.<br>\nThe lawyers seem to plead and cite decrees,<br>\nCommanders they to fight and go at frays,<br>\nSailors to live in combat with the winds,<br>\nAnd we ourselves indeed to make this book,<br>\nAnd still to seek the nature of the world<br>\nAnd set it down, when once discovered, here<br>\nIn these my country’s leaves. Thus all pursuits,<br>\nAll arts in general seem in sleeps to mock<br>\nAnd master the minds of men. And whosoever<br>\nDay after day for long to games have given<br>\nAttention undivided, still they keep<br>\n(As oft we note), even when they’ve ceased to grasp<br>\nThose games with their own senses, open paths<br>\nWithin the mind wherethrough the idol-films<br>\nOf just those games can come. And thus it is<br>\nFor many a day thereafter those appear<br>\nFloating before the eyes, that even awake<br>\nThey think they view the dancers moving round<br>\nTheir supple limbs, and catch with both the ears<br>\nThe liquid song of harp and speaking chords,<br>\nAnd view the same assembly on the seats,<br>\nAnd manifold bright glories of the stage—<br>\nSo great the influence of pursuit and zest,<br>\nAnd of the affairs wherein ‘thas been the wont<br>\nOf men to be engaged-nor only men,<br>\nBut soothly all the animals. Behold,<br>\nThou’lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,<br>\nYet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,<br>\nAnd straining utmost strength, as if for prize,<br>\nAs if, with barriers opened now…<br>\nAnd hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose<br>\nYet toss asudden all their legs about,<br>\nAnd growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff<br>\nThe winds again, again, as though indeed<br>\nThey’d caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,<br>\nAnd, even when wakened, often they pursue<br>\nThe phantom images of stags, as though<br>\nThey did perceive them fleeing on before,<br>\nUntil the illusion’s shaken off and dogs<br>\nCome to themselves again. And fawning breed<br>\nOf house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge<br>\nTo shake their bodies and start from off the ground,<br>\nAs if beholding stranger-visages.<br>\nAnd ever the fiercer be the stock, the more<br>\nIn sleep the same is ever bound to rage.<br>\nBut flee the divers tribes of birds and vex<br>\nWith sudden wings by night the groves of gods,<br>\nWhen in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed<br>\nOf hawks in chase, aswooping on for fight.<br>\nAgain, the minds of mortals which perform<br>\nWith mighty motions mighty enterprises,<br>\nOften in sleep will do and dare the same<br>\nIn manner like. Kings take the towns by storm,<br>\nSuccumb to capture, battle on the field,<br>\nRaise a wild cry as if their throats were cut<br>\nEven then and there. And many wrestle on<br>\nAnd groan with pains, and fill all regions round<br>\nWith mighty cries and wild, as if then gnawed<br>\nBy fangs of panther or of lion fierce.<br>\nMany amid their slumbers talk about<br>\nTheir mighty enterprises, and have often<br>\nEnough become the proof of their own crimes.<br>\nMany meet death; many, as if headlong<br>\nFrom lofty mountains tumbling down to earth<br>\nWith all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;<br>\nAnd after sleep, as if still mad in mind,<br>\nThey scarce come to, confounded as they are<br>\nBy ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,<br>\nLikewise, he sits beside delightful spring<br>\nOr river and gulpeth down with gaping throat<br>\nNigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,<br>\nBy sleep o’ermastered, think they lift their dress<br>\nBy pail or public jordan and then void<br>\nThe water filtered down their frame entire<br>\nAnd drench the Babylonian coverlets,<br>\nMagnificently bright. Again, those males<br>\nInto the surging channels of whose years<br>\nNow first has passed the seed (engendered<br>\nWithin their members by the ripened days)<br>\nAre in their sleep confronted from without<br>\nBy idol-images of some fair form—<br>\nTidings of glorious face and lovely bloom,<br>\nWhich stir and goad the regions turgid now<br>\nWith seed abundant; so that, as it were<br>\nWith all the matter acted duly out,<br>\nThey pour the billows of a potent stream<br>\nAnd stain their garment.</p>\n<p>                      And as said before,<br>\nThat seed is roused in us when once ripe age<br>\nHas made our body strong…<br>\nAs divers causes give to divers things<br>\nImpulse and irritation, so one force<br>\nIn human kind rouses the human seed<br>\nTo spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues,<br>\nForced from its first abodes, it passes down<br>\nIn the whole body through the limbs and frame,<br>\nMeeting in certain regions of our thews,<br>\nAnd stirs amain the genitals of man.<br>\nThe goaded regions swell with seed, and then<br>\nComes the delight to dart the same at what<br>\nThe mad desire so yearns, and body seeks<br>\nThat object, whence the mind by love is pierced.<br>\nFor well-nigh each man falleth toward his wound,<br>\nAnd our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence<br>\nThe stroke wherewith we are strook, and if indeed<br>\nThe foe be close, the red jet reaches him.<br>\nThus, one who gets a stroke from Venus’ shafts—<br>\nWhether a boy with limbs effeminate<br>\nAssault him, or a woman darting love<br>\nFrom all her body—that one strains to get<br>\nEven to the thing whereby he’s hit, and longs<br>\nTo join with it and cast into its frame<br>\nThe fluid drawn even from within its own.<br>\nFor the mute craving doth presage delight.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/iv/the-passion-of-love/\">BOOK IV - THE PASSION OF LOVE</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                        In these affairs"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWe crave that thou wilt passionately flee"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe one offence, and anxiously wilt shun"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe error of presuming the clear lights"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf eyes created were that we might see;"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOr thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThuswise can bended be, that we might step"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nUnto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOn either side were given, that we might do"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nLife’s own demands.
