Since, indeed,<br>\nThough she thou lovest now be far away,<br>\nYet idol-images of her are near<br>\nAnd the sweet name is floating in thy ear.<br>\nBut it behooves to flee those images;<br>\nAnd scare afar whatever feeds thy love;<br>\nAnd turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm,<br>\nWithin thee gathered, into sundry bodies,<br>\nNor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love,<br>\nKeep it for one delight, and so store up<br>\nCare for thyself and pain inevitable.<br>\nFor, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing<br>\nGrows to more life with deep inveteracy,<br>\nAnd day by day the fury swells aflame,<br>\nAnd the woe waxes heavier day by day—<br>\nUnless thou dost destroy even by new blows<br>\nThe former wounds of love, and curest them<br>\nWhile yet they’re fresh, by wandering freely round<br>\nAfter the freely-wandering Venus, or<br>\nCanst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy mind.</p>\n<p>Nor doth that man who keeps away from love<br>\nYet lack the fruits of Venus; rather takes<br>\nThose pleasures which are free of penalties.<br>\nFor the delights of Venus, verily,<br>\nAre more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul<br>\nThan for those sick-at-heart with love-pining.<br>\nYea, in the very moment of possessing,<br>\nSurges the heat of lovers to and fro,<br>\nRestive, uncertain; and they cannot fix<br>\nOn what to first enjoy with eyes and hands.<br>\nThe parts they sought for, those they squeeze so tight,<br>\nAnd pain the creature’s body, close their teeth<br>\nOften against her lips, and smite with kiss<br>\nMouth into mouth,—because this same delight<br>\nIs not unmixed; and underneath are stings<br>\nWhich goad a man to hurt the very thing,<br>\nWhate’er it be, from whence arise for him<br>\nThose germs of madness. But with gentle touch<br>\nVenus subdues the pangs in midst of love,<br>\nAnd the admixture of a fondling joy<br>\nDoth curb the bites of passion. For they hope<br>\nThat by the very body whence they caught<br>\nThe heats of love their flames can be put out.<br>\nBut nature protests ‘tis all quite otherwise;<br>\nFor this same love it is the one sole thing<br>\nOf which, the more we have, the fiercer burns<br>\nThe breast with fell desire. For food and drink<br>\nAre taken within our members; and, since they<br>\nCan stop up certain parts, thus, easily<br>\nDesire of water is glutted and of bread.<br>\nBut, lo, from human face and lovely bloom<br>\nNaught penetrates our frame to be enjoyed<br>\nSave flimsy idol-images and vain—<br>\nA sorry hope which oft the winds disperse.<br>\nAs when the thirsty man in slumber seeks<br>\nTo drink, and water ne’er is granted him<br>\nWherewith to quench the heat within his members,<br>\nBut after idols of the liquids strives<br>\nAnd toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps<br>\nIn middle of the torrent, thus in love<br>\nVenus deludes with idol-images<br>\nThe lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust<br>\nBy merely gazing on the bodies, nor<br>\nThey cannot with their palms and fingers rub<br>\nAught from each tender limb, the while they stray<br>\nUncertain over all the body. Then,<br>\nAt last, with members intertwined, when they<br>\nEnjoy the flower of their age, when now<br>\nTheir bodies have sweet presage of keen joys,<br>\nAnd Venus is about to sow the fields<br>\nOf woman, greedily their frames they lock,<br>\nAnd mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe<br>\nInto each other, pressing teeth on mouths—<br>\nYet to no purpose, since they’re powerless<br>\nTo rub off aught, or penetrate and pass<br>\nWith body entire into body—for oft<br>\nThey seem to strive and struggle thus to do;<br>\nSo eagerly they cling in Venus’ bonds,<br>\nWhilst melt away their members, overcome<br>\nBy violence of delight. But when at last<br>\nLust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself,<br>\nThere come a brief pause in the raging heat—<br>\nBut then a madness just the same returns<br>\nAnd that old fury visits them again,<br>\nWhen once again they seek and crave to reach<br>\nThey know not what, all powerless to find<br>\nThe artifice to subjugate the bane.<br>\nIn such uncertain state they waste away<br>\nWith unseen wound.</p>\n<p>                 To which be added too,<br>\nThey squander powers and with the travail wane;<br>\nBe added too, they spend their futile years<br>\nUnder another’s beck and call; their duties<br>\nNeglected languish and their honest name<br>\nReeleth sick, sick; and meantime their estates<br>\nAre lost in Babylonian tapestries;<br>\nAnd unguents and dainty Sicyonian shoes<br>\nLaugh on her feet; and (as ye may be sure)<br>\nBig emeralds of green light are set in gold;<br>\nAnd rich sea-purple dress by constant wear<br>\nGrows shabby and all soaked with Venus’ sweat;<br>\nAnd the well-earned ancestral property<br>\nBecometh head-bands, coifs, and many a time<br>\nThe cloaks, or garments Alidensian<br>\nOr of the Cean isle. And banquets, set<br>\nWith rarest cloth and viands, are prepared—<br>\nAnd games of chance, and many a drinking cup,<br>\nAnd unguents, crowns and garlands. All in vain,<br>\nSince from amid the well-spring of delights<br>\nBubbles some drop of bitter to torment<br>\nAmong the very flowers—when haply mind<br>\nGnaws into self, now stricken with remorse<br>\nFor slothful years and ruin in baudels,<br>\nOr else because she’s left him all in doubt<br>\nBy launching some sly word, which still like fire<br>\nLives wildly, cleaving to his eager heart;<br>\nOr else because he thinks she darts her eyes<br>\nToo much about and gazes at another,—<br>\nAnd in her face sees traces of a laugh.</p>\n<p>These ills are found in prospering love and true;<br>\nBut in crossed love and helpless there be such<br>\nAs through shut eyelids thou canst still take in—<br>\nUncounted ills; so that ‘tis better far<br>\nTo watch beforehand, in the way I’ve shown,<br>\nAnd guard against enticements. For to shun<br>\nA fall into the hunting-snares of love<br>\nIs not so hard, as to get out again,<br>\nWhen tangled in the very nets, and burst<br>\nThe stoutly-knotted cords of Aphrodite.<br>\nYet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet,<br>\nStill canst thou scape the danger-lest indeed<br>\nThou standest in the way of thine own good,<br>\nAnd overlookest first all blemishes<br>\nOf mind and body of thy much preferred,<br>\nDesirable dame. For so men do,<br>\nEyeless with passion, and assign to them<br>\nGraces not theirs in fact. And thus we see<br>\nCreatures in many a wise crooked and ugly<br>\nThe prosperous sweethearts in a high esteem;<br>\nAnd lovers gird each other and advise<br>\nTo placate Venus, since their friends are smit<br>\nWith a base passion—miserable dupes<br>\nWho seldom mark their own worst bane of all.<br>\nThe black-skinned girl is “tawny like the honey”;<br>\nThe filthy and the fetid’s “negligee”;<br>\nThe cat-eyed she’s “a little Pallas,” she;<br>\nThe sinewy and wizened’s “a gazelle”;<br>\nThe pudgy and the pigmy is “piquant,<br>\nOne of the Graces sure”; the big and bulky<br>\nO she’s “an Admiration, imposante”;<br>\nThe stuttering and tongue-tied “sweetly lisps”;<br>\nThe mute girl’s “modest”; and the garrulous,<br>\nThe spiteful spit-fire, is “a sparkling wit”;<br>\nAnd she who scarcely lives for scrawniness<br>\nBecomes “a slender darling”; “delicate”<br>\nIs she who’s nearly dead of coughing-fit;<br>\nThe pursy female with protuberant breasts<br>\nShe is “like Ceres when the goddess gave<br>\nYoung Bacchus suck”; the pug-nosed lady-love<br>\n“A Satyress, a feminine Silenus”;<br>\nThe blubber-lipped is “all one luscious kiss”—<br>\nA weary while it were to tell the whole.<br>\nBut let her face possess what charm ye will,<br>\nLet Venus’ glory rise from all her limbs,—<br>\nForsooth there still are others; and forsooth<br>\nWe lived before without her; and forsooth<br>\nShe does the same things—and we know she does—<br>\nAll, as the ugly creature, and she scents,<br>\nYes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes;<br>\nWhom even her handmaids flee and giggle at<br>\nBehind her back. But he, the lover, in tears<br>\nBecause shut out, covers her threshold o’er<br>\nOften with flowers and garlands, and anoints<br>\nHer haughty door-posts with the marjoram,<br>\nAnd prints, poor fellow, kisses on the doors—<br>\nAdmitted at last, if haply but one whiff<br>\nGot to him on approaching, he would seek<br>\nDecent excuses to go out forthwith;<br>\nAnd his lament, long pondered, then would fall<br>\nDown at his heels; and there he’d damn himself<br>\nFor his fatuity, observing how<br>\nHe had assigned to that same lady more—<br>\nThan it is proper to concede to mortals.<br>\nAnd these our Venuses are ‘ware of this.<br>\nWherefore the more are they at pains to hide<br>\nAll the-behind-the-scenes of life from those<br>\nWhom they desire to keep in bonds of love—<br>\nIn vain, since ne’ertheless thou canst by thought<br>\nDrag all the matter forth into the light<br>\nAnd well search out the cause of all these smiles;<br>\nAnd if of graceful mind she be and kind,<br>\nDo thou, in thy turn, overlook the same,<br>\nAnd thus allow for poor mortality.<br>\nNor sighs the woman always with feigned love,<br>\nWho links her body round man’s body locked<br>\nAnd holds him fast, making his kisses wet<br>\nWith lips sucked into lips; for oft she acts<br>\nEven from desire, and, seeking mutual joys,<br>\nIncites him there to run love’s race-course through.<br>\nNor otherwise can cattle, birds, wild beasts,<br>\nAnd sheep and mares submit unto the males,<br>\nExcept that their own nature is in heat,<br>\nAnd burns abounding and with gladness takes<br>\nOnce more the Venus of the mounting males.<br>\nAnd seest thou not how those whom mutual pleasure<br>\nHath bound are tortured in their common bonds?<br>\nHow often in the cross-roads dogs that pant<br>\nTo get apart strain eagerly asunder<br>\nWith utmost might?—When all the while they’re fast<br>\nIn the stout links of Venus. But they’d ne’er<br>\nSo pull, except they knew those mutual joys—<br>\nSo powerful to cast them unto snares<br>\nAnd hold them bound. Wherefore again, again,<br>\nEven as I say, there is a joint delight.</p>\n<p>And when perchance, in mingling seed with his,<br>\nThe female hath o’erpowered the force of male<br>\nAnd by a sudden fling hath seized it fast,<br>\nThen are the offspring, more from mothers’ seed,<br>\nMore like their mothers; as, from fathers’ seed,<br>\nThey’re like to fathers. But whom seest to be<br>\nPartakers of each shape, one equal blend<br>\nOf parents’ features, these are generate<br>\nFrom fathers’ body and from mothers’ blood,<br>\nWhen mutual and harmonious heat hath dashed<br>\nTogether seeds, aroused along their frames<br>\nBy Venus’ goads, and neither of the twain<br>\nMastereth or is mastered. Happens too<br>\nThat sometimes offspring can to being come<br>\nIn likeness of their grandsires, and bring back<br>\nOften the shapes of grandsires’ sires, because<br>\nTheir parents in their bodies oft retain<br>\nConcealed many primal germs, commixed<br>\nIn many modes, which, starting with the stock,<br>\nSire handeth down to son, himself a sire;<br>\nWhence Venus by a variable chance<br>\nEngenders shapes, and diversely brings back<br>\nAncestral features, voices too, and hair.<br>\nA female generation rises forth<br>\nFrom seed paternal, and from mother’s body<br>\nExist created males: since sex proceeds<br>\nNo more from singleness of seed than faces<br>\nOr bodies or limbs of ours: for every birth<br>\nIs from a twofold seed; and what’s created<br>\nHath, of that parent which it is more like,<br>\nMore than its equal share; as thou canst mark,—<br>\nWhether the breed be male or female stock.</p>\n<p>Nor do the powers divine grudge any man<br>\nThe fruits of his seed-sowing, so that never<br>\nHe be called “father” by sweet children his,<br>\nAnd end his days in sterile love forever.<br>\nWhat many men suppose; and gloomily<br>\nThey sprinkle the altars with abundant blood,<br>\nAnd make the high platforms odorous with burnt gifts,<br>\nTo render big by plenteous seed their wives—<br>\nAnd plague in vain godheads and sacred lots.<br>\nFor sterile are these men by seed too thick,<br>\nOr else by far too watery and thin.<br>\nBecause the thin is powerless to cleave<br>\nFast to the proper places, straightaway<br>\nIt trickles from them, and, returned again,<br>\nRetires abortively. And then since seed<br>\nMore gross and solid than will suit is spent<br>\nBy some men, either it flies not forth amain<br>\nWith spurt prolonged enough, or else it fails<br>\nTo enter suitably the proper places,<br>\nOr, having entered, the seed is weakly mixed<br>\nWith seed of the woman: harmonies of Venus<br>\nAre seen to matter vastly here; and some<br>\nImpregnate some more readily, and from some<br>\nSome women conceive more readily and become<br>\nPregnant. And many women, sterile before<br>\nIn several marriage-beds, have yet thereafter<br>\nObtained the mates from whom they could conceive<br>\nThe baby-boys, and with sweet progeny<br>\nGrow rich. And even for husbands (whose own wives,<br>\nAlthough of fertile wombs, have borne for them<br>\nNo babies in the house) are also found<br>\nConcordant natures so that they at last<br>\nCan bulwark their old age with goodly sons.<br>\nA matter of great moment ‘tis in truth,<br>\nThat seeds may mingle readily with seeds<br>\nSuited for procreation, and that thick<br>\nShould mix with fluid seeds, with thick the fluid.<br>\nAnd in this business ‘tis of some import<br>\nUpon what diet life is nourished:<br>\nFor some foods thicken seeds within our members,<br>\nAnd others thin them out and waste away.<br>\nAnd in what modes the fond delight itself<br>\nIs carried on—this too importeth vastly.<br>\nFor commonly ‘tis thought that wives conceive<br>\nMore readily in manner of wild-beasts,<br>\nAfter the custom of the four-foot breeds,<br>\nBecause so postured, with the breasts beneath<br>\nAnd buttocks then upreared, the seeds can take<br>\nTheir proper places. Nor is need the least<br>\nFor wives to use the motions of blandishment;<br>\nFor thus the woman hinders and resists<br>\nHer own conception, if too joyously<br>\nHerself she treats the Venus of the man<br>\nWith haunches heaving, and with all her bosom<br>\nNow yielding like the billows of the sea—<br>\nAye, from the ploughshare’s even course and track<br>\nShe throws the furrow, and from proper places<br>\nDeflects the spurt of seed. And courtesans<br>\nAre thuswise wont to move for their own ends,<br>\nTo keep from pregnancy and lying in,<br>\nAnd all the while to render Venus more<br>\nA pleasure for the men—the which meseems<br>\nOur wives have never need of.</p>\n<p>                           Sometimes too<br>\nIt happens—and through no divinity<br>\nNor arrows of Venus—that a sorry chit<br>\nOf scanty grace will be beloved by man;<br>\nFor sometimes she herself by very deeds,<br>\nBy her complying ways, and tidy habits,<br>\nWill easily accustom thee to pass<br>\nWith her thy life-time—and, moreover, lo,<br>\nLong habitude can gender human love,<br>\nEven as an object smitten o’er and o’er<br>\nBy blows, however lightly, yet at last<br>\nIs overcome and wavers. Seest thou not,<br>\nBesides, how drops of water falling down<br>\nAgainst the stones at last bore through the stones?</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/v/proem/\">BOOK V - PROEM</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This craving ‘tis that’s Venus unto us:"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom this, engender all the lures of love,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom this, O first hath into human hearts"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTrickled that drop of joyance which ere long"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIs by chill care succeeded.
