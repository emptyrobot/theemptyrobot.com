Nor ever cease to flit<br>\nThe varied voices, sounds athrough the air.<br>\nThen too there comes into the mouth at times<br>\nThe wet of a salt taste, when by the sea<br>\nWe roam about; and so, whene’er we watch<br>\nThe wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.<br>\nTo such degree from all things is each thing<br>\nBorne streamingly along, and sent about<br>\nTo every region round; and nature grants<br>\nNor rest nor respite of the onward flow,<br>\nSince ‘tis incessantly we feeling have,<br>\nAnd all the time are suffered to descry<br>\nAnd smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.<br>\nBesides, since shape examined by our hands<br>\nWithin the dark is known to be the same<br>\nAs that by eyes perceived within the light<br>\nAnd lustrous day, both touch and sight must be<br>\nBy one like cause aroused. So, if we test<br>\nA square and get its stimulus on us<br>\nWithin the dark, within the light what square<br>\nCan fall upon our sight, except a square<br>\nThat images the things? Wherefore it seems<br>\nThe source of seeing is in images,<br>\nNor without these can anything be viewed.</p>\n<p>Now these same films I name are borne about<br>\nAnd tossed and scattered into regions all.<br>\nBut since we do perceive alone through eyes,<br>\nIt follows hence that whitherso we turn<br>\nOur sight, all things do strike against it there<br>\nWith form and hue. And just how far from us<br>\nEach thing may be away, the image yields<br>\nTo us the power to see and chance to tell:<br>\nFor when ‘tis sent, at once it shoves ahead<br>\nAnd drives along the air that’s in the space<br>\nBetwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air<br>\nAll glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as ‘twere,<br>\nBrushes athrough our pupils and thuswise<br>\nPasses across. Therefore it comes we see<br>\nHow far from us each thing may be away,<br>\nAnd the more air there be that’s driven before,<br>\nAnd too the longer be the brushing breeze<br>\nAgainst our eyes, the farther off removed<br>\nEach thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work<br>\nWith mightily swift order all goes on,<br>\nSo that upon one instant we may see<br>\nWhat kind the object and how far away.</p>\n<p>Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed<br>\nIn these affairs that, though the films which strike<br>\nUpon the eyes cannot be singly seen,<br>\nThe things themselves may be perceived. For thus<br>\nWhen the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke<br>\nAnd when the sharp cold streams, ‘tis not our wont<br>\nTo feel each private particle of wind<br>\nOr of that cold, but rather all at once;<br>\nAnd so we see how blows affect our body,<br>\nAs if one thing were beating on the same<br>\nAnd giving us the feel of its own body<br>\nOutside of us. Again, whene’er we thump<br>\nWith finger-tip upon a stone, we touch<br>\nBut the rock’s surface and the outer hue,<br>\nNor feel that hue by contact—rather feel<br>\nThe very hardness deep within the rock.</p>\n<p>Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass<br>\nAn image may be seen, perceive. For seen<br>\nIt soothly is, removed far within.<br>\n‘Tis the same sort as objects peered upon<br>\nOutside in their true shape, whene’er a door<br>\nYields through itself an open peering-place,<br>\nAnd lets us see so many things outside<br>\nBeyond the house. Also that sight is made<br>\nBy a twofold twin air: for first is seen<br>\nThe air inside the door-posts; next the doors,<br>\nThe twain to left and right; and afterwards<br>\nA light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,<br>\nThen other air, then objects peered upon<br>\nOutside in their true shape. And thus, when first<br>\nThe image of the glass projects itself,<br>\nAs to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead<br>\nAnd drives along the air that’s in the space<br>\nBetwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass<br>\nThat we perceive the air ere yet the glass.<br>\nBut when we’ve also seen the glass itself,<br>\nForthwith that image which from us is borne<br>\nReaches the glass, and there thrown back again<br>\nComes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls<br>\nAhead of itself another air, that then<br>\n‘Tis this we see before itself, and thus<br>\nIt looks so far removed behind the glass.<br>\nWherefore again, again, there’s naught for wonder</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In those which render from the mirror’s plane<br>\nA vision back, since each thing comes to pass<br>\nBy means of the two airs. Now, in the glass<br>\nThe right part of our members is observed<br>\nUpon the left, because, when comes the image<br>\nHitting against the level of the glass,<br>\n‘Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off<br>\nBackwards in line direct and not oblique,—<br>\nExactly as whoso his plaster-mask<br>\nShould dash, before ‘twere dry, on post or beam,<br>\nAnd it should straightway keep, at clinging there,<br>\nIts shape, reversed, facing him who threw,<br>\nAnd so remould the features it gives back:<br>\nIt comes that now the right eye is the left,<br>\nThe left the right. An image too may be<br>\nFrom mirror into mirror handed on,<br>\nUntil of idol-films even five or six<br>\nHave thus been gendered. For whatever things<br>\nShall hide back yonder in the house, the same,<br>\nHowever far removed in twisting ways,<br>\nMay still be all brought forth through bending paths<br>\nAnd by these several mirrors seen to be<br>\nWithin the house, since nature so compels<br>\nAll things to be borne backward and spring off<br>\nAt equal angles from all other things.<br>\nTo such degree the image gleams across<br>\nFrom mirror unto mirror; where ‘twas left<br>\nIt comes to be the right, and then again<br>\nReturns and changes round unto the left.<br>\nAgain, those little sides of mirrors curved<br>\nProportionate to the bulge of our own flank<br>\nSend back to us their idols with the right<br>\nUpon the right; and this is so because<br>\nEither the image is passed on along<br>\nFrom mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,<br>\nWhen twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;<br>\nOr else the image wheels itself around,<br>\nWhen once unto the mirror it has come,<br>\nSince the curved surface teaches it to turn<br>\nTo usward. Further, thou might’st well believe<br>\nThat these film-idols step along with us<br>\nAnd set their feet in unison with ours<br>\nAnd imitate our carriage, since from that<br>\nPart of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn<br>\nStraightway no images can be returned.</p>\n<p>Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright<br>\nAnd shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,<br>\nIf thou goest on to strain them unto him,<br>\nBecause his strength is mighty, and the films<br>\nHeavily downward from on high are borne<br>\nThrough the pure ether and the viewless winds,<br>\nAnd strike the eyes, disordering their joints.<br>\nSo piecing lustre often burns the eyes,<br>\nBecause it holdeth many seeds of fire<br>\nWhich, working into eyes, engender pain.<br>\nAgain, whatever jaundiced people view<br>\nBecomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies<br>\nFlow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet<br>\nThe films of things, and many too are mixed<br>\nWithin their eye, which by contagion paint<br>\nAll things with sallowness. Again, we view<br>\nFrom dark recesses things that stand in light,<br>\nBecause, when first has entered and possessed<br>\nThe open eyes this nearer darkling air,<br>\nSwiftly the shining air and luminous<br>\nFolloweth in, which purges then the eyes<br>\nAnd scatters asunder of that other air<br>\nThe sable shadows, for in large degrees<br>\nThis air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.<br>\nAnd soon as ever ‘thas filled and oped with light<br>\nThe pathways of the eyeballs, which before<br>\nBlack air had blocked, there follow straightaway<br>\nThose films of things out-standing in the light,<br>\nProvoking vision—what we cannot do<br>\nFrom out the light with objects in the dark,<br>\nBecause that denser darkling air behind<br>\nFolloweth in, and fills each aperture<br>\nAnd thus blockades the pathways of the eyes<br>\nThat there no images of any things<br>\nCan be thrown in and agitate the eyes.</p>\n<p>And when from far away we do behold<br>\nThe squared towers of a city, oft<br>\nRounded they seem,—on this account because<br>\nEach distant angle is perceived obtuse,<br>\nOr rather it is not perceived at all;<br>\nAnd perishes its blow nor to our gaze<br>\nArrives its stroke, since through such length of air<br>\nAre borne along the idols that the air<br>\nMakes blunt the idol of the angle’s point<br>\nBy numerous collidings. When thuswise<br>\nThe angles of the tower each and all<br>\nHave quite escaped the sense, the stones appear<br>\nAs rubbed and rounded on a turner’s wheel—<br>\nYet not like objects near and truly round,<br>\nBut with a semblance to them, shadowily.<br>\nLikewise, our shadow in the sun appears<br>\nTo move along and follow our own steps<br>\nAnd imitate our carriage—if thou thinkest<br>\nAir that is thus bereft of light can walk,<br>\nFollowing the gait and motion of mankind.<br>\nFor what we use to name a shadow, sure<br>\nIs naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:<br>\nBecause the earth from spot to spot is reft<br>\nProgressively of light of sun, whenever<br>\nIn moving round we get within its way,<br>\nWhile any spot of earth by us abandoned<br>\nIs filled with light again, on this account<br>\nIt comes to pass that what was body’s shadow<br>\nSeems still the same to follow after us<br>\nIn one straight course. Since, evermore pour in<br>\nNew lights of rays, and perish then the old,<br>\nJust like the wool that’s drawn into the flame.<br>\nTherefore the earth is easily spoiled of light<br>\nAnd easily refilled and from herself<br>\nWasheth the black shadows quite away.</p>\n<p>And yet in this we don’t at all concede<br>\nThat eyes be cheated. For their task it is<br>\nTo note in whatsoever place be light,<br>\nIn what be shadow: whether or no the gleams<br>\nBe still the same, and whether the shadow which<br>\nJust now was here is that one passing thither,<br>\nOr whether the facts be what we said above,<br>\n‘Tis after all the reasoning of mind<br>\nThat must decide; nor can our eyeballs know<br>\nThe nature of reality. And so<br>\nAttach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,<br>\nNor lightly think our senses everywhere<br>\nAre tottering. The ship in which we sail<br>\nIs borne along, although it seems to stand;<br>\nThe ship that bides in roadstead is supposed<br>\nThere to be passing by. And hills and fields<br>\nSeem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge<br>\nThe ship and fly under the bellying sails.<br>\nThe stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed<br>\nTo the ethereal caverns, though they all<br>\nForever are in motion, rising out<br>\nAnd thence revisiting their far descents<br>\nWhen they have measured with their bodies bright<br>\nThe span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon<br>\nSeem biding in a roadstead,—objects which,<br>\nAs plain fact proves, are really borne along.<br>\nBetween two mountains far away aloft<br>\nFrom midst the whirl of waters open lies<br>\nA gaping exit for the fleet, and yet<br>\nThey seem conjoined in a single isle.<br>\nWhen boys themselves have stopped their spinning round,<br>\nThe halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,<br>\nUntil they now must almost think the roofs<br>\nThreaten to ruin down upon their heads.<br>\nAnd now, when nature begins to lift on high<br>\nThe sun’s red splendour and the tremulous fires,<br>\nAnd raise him o’er the mountain-tops, those mountains—<br>\nO’er which he seemeth then to thee to be,<br>\nHis glowing self hard by atingeing them<br>\nWith his own fire—are yet away from us<br>\nScarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed<br>\nOft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;<br>\nAlthough between those mountains and the sun<br>\nLie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath<br>\nThe vasty shores of ether, and intervene<br>\nA thousand lands, possessed by many a folk<br>\nAnd generations of wild beasts. Again,<br>\nA pool of water of but a finger’s depth,<br>\nWhich lies between the stones along the pave,<br>\nOffers a vision downward into earth<br>\nAs far, as from the earth o’erspread on high<br>\nThe gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view<br>\nClouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged<br>\nWondrously in heaven under earth.<br>\nThen too, when in the middle of the stream<br>\nSticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze<br>\nInto the river’s rapid waves, some force<br>\nSeems then to bear the body of the horse,<br>\nThough standing still, reversely from his course,<br>\nAnd swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe’er<br>\nWe cast our eyes across, all objects seem<br>\nThus to be onward borne and flow along<br>\nIn the same way as we. A portico,<br>\nAlbeit it stands well propped from end to end<br>\nOn equal columns, parallel and big,<br>\nContracts by stages in a narrow cone,<br>\nWhen from one end the long, long whole is seen,—<br>\nUntil, conjoining ceiling with the floor,<br>\nAnd the whole right side with the left, it draws<br>\nTogether to a cone’s nigh-viewless point.<br>\nTo sailors on the main the sun he seems<br>\nFrom out the waves to rise, and in the waves<br>\nTo set and bury his light—because indeed<br>\nThey gaze on naught but water and the sky.<br>\nAgain, to gazers ignorant of the sea,<br>\nVessels in port seem, as with broken poops,<br>\nTo lean upon the water, quite agog;<br>\nFor any portion of the oars that’s raised<br>\nAbove the briny spray is straight, and straight<br>\nThe rudders from above. But other parts,<br>\nThose sunk, immersed below the water-line,<br>\nSeem broken all and bended and inclined<br>\nSloping to upwards, and turned back to float<br>\nAlmost atop the water. And when the winds<br>\nCarry the scattered drifts along the sky<br>\nIn the night-time, then seem to glide along<br>\nThe radiant constellations ‘gainst the clouds<br>\nAnd there on high to take far other course<br>\nFrom that whereon in truth they’re borne. And then,<br>\nIf haply our hand be set beneath one eye<br>\nAnd press below thereon, then to our gaze<br>\nEach object which we gaze on seems to be,<br>\nBy some sensation twain—then twain the lights<br>\nOf lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,<br>\nAnd twain the furniture in all the house,<br>\nTwo-fold the visages of fellow-men,<br>\nAnd twain their bodies. And again, when sleep<br>\nHas bound our members down in slumber soft<br>\nAnd all the body lies in deep repose,<br>\nYet then we seem to self to be awake<br>\nAnd move our members; and in night’s blind gloom<br>\nWe think to mark the daylight and the sun;<br>\nAnd, shut within a room, yet still we seem<br>\nTo change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,<br>\nTo cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,<br>\nThough still the austere silence of the night<br>\nAbides around us, and to speak replies,<br>\nThough voiceless. Other cases of the sort<br>\nWondrously many do we see, which all<br>\nSeek, so to say, to injure faith in sense—<br>\nIn vain, because the largest part of these<br>\nDeceives through mere opinions of the mind,<br>\nWhich we do add ourselves, feigning to see<br>\nWhat by the senses are not seen at all.<br>\nFor naught is harder than to separate<br>\nPlain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith<br>\nAdds by itself.</p>\n<p>               Again, if one suppose<br>\nThat naught is known, he knows not whether this<br>\nItself is able to be known, since he<br>\nConfesses naught to know. Therefore with him<br>\nI waive discussion—who has set his head<br>\nEven where his feet should be. But let me grant<br>\nThat this he knows,—I question: whence he knows<br>\nWhat ‘tis to know and not-to-know in turn,<br>\nAnd what created concept of the truth,<br>\nAnd what device has proved the dubious<br>\nTo differ from the certain?—since in things<br>\nHe’s heretofore seen naught of true. Thou’lt find<br>\nThat from the senses first hath been create<br>\nConcept of truth, nor can the senses be<br>\nRebutted. For criterion must be found<br>\nWorthy of greater trust, which shall defeat<br>\nThrough own authority the false by true;<br>\nWhat, then, than these our senses must there be<br>\nWorthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung<br>\nFrom some false sense, prevail to contradict<br>\nThose senses, sprung as reason wholly is<br>\nFrom out the senses?—For lest these be true,<br>\nAll reason also then is falsified.<br>\nOr shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,<br>\nOr yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste<br>\nAccuse this touch or shall the nose confute<br>\nOr eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:<br>\nFor unto each has been divided off<br>\nIts function quite apart, its power to each;<br>\nAnd thus we’re still constrained to perceive<br>\nThe soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart<br>\nAll divers hues and whatso things there be<br>\nConjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue<br>\nHas its own power apart, and smells apart<br>\nAnd sounds apart are known. And thus it is<br>\nThat no one sense can e’er convict another.<br>\nNor shall one sense have power to blame itself,<br>\nBecause it always must be deemed the same,<br>\nWorthy of equal trust. And therefore what<br>\nAt any time unto these senses showed,<br>\nThe same is true. And if the reason be<br>\nUnable to unravel us the cause<br>\nWhy objects, which at hand were square, afar<br>\nSeemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,<br>\nLacking the reason, to pretend a cause<br>\nFor each configuration, than to let<br>\nFrom out our hands escape the obvious things<br>\nAnd injure primal faith in sense, and wreck<br>\nAll those foundations upon which do rest<br>\nOur life and safety. For not only reason<br>\nWould topple down; but even our very life<br>\nWould straightaway collapse, unless we dared<br>\nTo trust our senses and to keep away<br>\nFrom headlong heights and places to be shunned<br>\nOf a like peril, and to seek with speed<br>\nTheir opposites! Again, as in a building,<br>\nIf the first plumb-line be askew, and if<br>\nThe square deceiving swerve from lines exact,<br>\nAnd if the level waver but the least<br>\nIn any part, the whole construction then<br>\nMust turn out faulty—shelving and askew,<br>\nLeaning to back and front, incongruous,<br>\nThat now some portions seem about to fall,<br>\nAnd falls the whole ere long—betrayed indeed<br>\nBy first deceiving estimates: so too<br>\nThy calculations in affairs of life<br>\nMust be askew and false, if sprung for thee<br>\nFrom senses false. So all that troop of words<br>\nMarshalled against the senses is quite vain.</p>\n<p>And now remains to demonstrate with ease<br>\nHow other senses each their things perceive.</p>\n<p>Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,<br>\nWhen, getting into ears, they strike the sense<br>\nWith their own body. For confess we must<br>\nEven voice and sound to be corporeal,<br>\nBecause they’re able on the sense to strike.<br>\nBesides voice often scrapes against the throat,<br>\nAnd screams in going out do make more rough<br>\nThe wind-pipe—naturally enough, methinks,<br>\nWhen, through the narrow exit rising up<br>\nIn larger throng, these primal germs of voice<br>\nHave thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,<br>\nAlso the door of the mouth is scraped against<br>\n[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words<br>\nConsist of elements corporeal,<br>\nWith power to pain. Nor art thou unaware<br>\nLikewise how much of body’s ta’en away,<br>\nHow much from very thews and powers of men<br>\nMay be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged<br>\nEven from the rising splendour of the morn<br>\nTo shadows of black evening,—above all<br>\nIf ‘t be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.<br>\nTherefore the voice must be corporeal,<br>\nSince the long talker loses from his frame<br>\nA part.</p>\n<p>     Moreover, roughness in the sound<br>\nComes from the roughness in the primal germs,<br>\nAs a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;<br>\nNor have these elements a form the same<br>\nWhen the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,<br>\nAs when barbaric Berecynthian pipe<br>\nBuzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans<br>\nBy night from icy shores of Helicon<br>\nWith wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.</p>\n<p>Thus, when from deep within our frame we force<br>\nThese voices, and at mouth expel them forth,<br>\nThe mobile tongue, artificer of words,<br>\nMakes them articulate, and too the lips<br>\nBy their formations share in shaping them.<br>\nHence when the space is short from starting-point<br>\nTo where that voice arrives, the very words<br>\nMust too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.<br>\nFor then the voice conserves its own formation,<br>\nConserves its shape. But if the space between<br>\nBe longer than is fit, the words must be<br>\nThrough the much air confounded, and the voice<br>\nDisordered in its flight across the winds—<br>\nAnd so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,<br>\nYet not determine what the words may mean;<br>\nTo such degree confounded and encumbered<br>\nThe voice approaches us. Again, one word,<br>\nSent from the crier’s mouth, may rouse all ears<br>\nAmong the populace. And thus one voice<br>\nScatters asunder into many voices,<br>\nSince it divides itself for separate ears,<br>\nImprinting form of word and a clear tone.<br>\nBut whatso part of voices fails to hit<br>\nThe ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,<br>\nIdly diffused among the winds. A part,<br>\nBeating on solid porticoes, tossed back<br>\nReturns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear<br>\nWith a mere phantom of a word. When this<br>\nThou well hast noted, thou canst render count<br>\nUnto thyself and others why it is<br>\nAlong the lonely places that the rocks<br>\nGive back like shapes of words in order like,<br>\nWhen search we after comrades wandering<br>\nAmong the shady mountains, and aloud<br>\nCall unto them, the scattered. I have seen<br>\nSpots that gave back even voices six or seven<br>\nFor one thrown forth—for so the very hills,<br>\nDashing them back against the hills, kept on<br>\nWith their reverberations. And these spots<br>\nThe neighbouring country-side doth feign to be<br>\nHaunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;<br>\nAnd tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise<br>\nAnd antic revels yonder they declare<br>\nThe voiceless silences are broken oft,<br>\nAnd tones of strings are made and wailings sweet<br>\nWhich the pipe, beat by players’ finger-tips,<br>\nPours out; and far and wide the farmer-race<br>\nBegins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings<br>\nOf pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan<br>\nWith puckered lip oft runneth o’er and o’er<br>\nThe open reeds,—lest flute should cease to pour<br>\nThe woodland music! Other prodigies<br>\nAnd wonders of this ilk they love to tell,<br>\nLest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots<br>\nAnd even by gods deserted. This is why<br>\nThey boast of marvels in their story-tellings;<br>\nOr by some other reason are led on—<br>\nGreedy, as all mankind hath ever been,<br>\nTo prattle fables into ears.</p>\n<p>                           Again,<br>\nOne need not wonder how it comes about<br>\nThat through those places (through which eyes cannot<br>\nView objects manifest) sounds yet may pass<br>\nAnd assail the ears. For often we observe<br>\nPeople conversing, though the doors be closed;<br>\nNo marvel either, since all voice unharmed<br>\nCan wind through bended apertures of things,<br>\nWhile idol-films decline to—for they’re rent,<br>\nUnless along straight apertures they swim,<br>\nLike those in glass, through which all images<br>\nDo fly across. And yet this voice itself,<br>\nIn passing through shut chambers of a house,<br>\nIs dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,<br>\nAnd sound we seem to hear far more than words.<br>\nMoreover, a voice is into all directions<br>\nDivided up, since off from one another<br>\nNew voices are engendered, when one voice<br>\nHath once leapt forth, outstarting into many—<br>\nAs oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle<br>\nItself into its several fires. And so,<br>\nVoices do fill those places hid behind,<br>\nWhich all are in a hubbub round about,<br>\nAstir with sound. But idol-films do tend,<br>\nAs once sent forth, in straight directions all;<br>\nWherefore one can inside a wall see naught,<br>\nYet catch the voices from beyond the same.</p>\n<p>Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,<br>\nPresent more problems for more work of thought.<br>\nFirstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,<br>\nWhen forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,—<br>\nAs any one perchance begins to squeeze<br>\nWith hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.<br>\nNext, all which forth we squeeze is spread about<br>\nAlong the pores and intertwined paths<br>\nOf the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth<br>\nThe bodies of the oozy flavour, then<br>\nDelightfully they touch, delightfully<br>\nThey treat all spots, around the wet and trickling<br>\nEnclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,<br>\nThey sting and pain the sense with their assault,<br>\nAccording as with roughness they’re supplied.<br>\nNext, only up to palate is the pleasure<br>\nComing from flavour; for in truth when down<br>\n‘Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,<br>\nWhilst into all the frame it spreads around;<br>\nNor aught it matters with what food is fed<br>\nThe body, if only what thou take thou canst<br>\nDistribute well digested to the frame<br>\nAnd keep the stomach in a moist career.</p>\n<p>Now, how it is we see some food for some,<br>\nOthers for others…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I will unfold, or wherefore what to some<br>\nIs foul and bitter, yet the same to others<br>\nCan seem delectable to eat,—why here<br>\nSo great the distance and the difference is<br>\nThat what is food to one to some becomes<br>\nFierce poison, as a certain snake there is<br>\nWhich, touched by spittle of a man, will waste<br>\nAnd end itself by gnawing up its coil.<br>\nAgain, fierce poison is the hellebore<br>\nTo us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.<br>\nThat thou mayst know by what devices this<br>\nIs brought about, in chief thou must recall<br>\nWhat we have said before, that seeds are kept<br>\nCommixed in things in divers modes. Again,<br>\nAs all the breathing creatures which take food<br>\nAre outwardly unlike, and outer cut<br>\nAnd contour of their members bounds them round,<br>\nEach differing kind by kind, they thus consist<br>\nOf seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,<br>\nSince seeds do differ, divers too must be<br>\nThe interstices and paths (which we do call<br>\nThe apertures) in all the members, even<br>\nIn mouth and palate too. Thus some must be<br>\nMore small or yet more large, three-cornered some<br>\nAnd others squared, and many others round,<br>\nAnd certain of them many-angled too<br>\nIn many modes. For, as the combination<br>\nAnd motion of their divers shapes demand,<br>\nThe shapes of apertures must be diverse<br>\nAnd paths must vary according to their walls<br>\nThat bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,<br>\nBecomes to others bitter, for him to whom<br>\n‘Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs<br>\nHave entered caressingly the palate’s pores.<br>\nAnd, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet<br>\nIs sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt<br>\nThe rough and barbed particles have got<br>\nInto the narrows of the apertures.<br>\nNow easy it is from these affairs to know<br>\nWhatever…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Indeed, where one from o’er-abundant bile<br>\nIs stricken with fever, or in other wise<br>\nFeels the roused violence of some malady,<br>\nThere the whole frame is now upset, and there<br>\nAll the positions of the seeds are changed,—<br>\nSo that the bodies which before were fit<br>\nTo cause the savour, now are fit no more,<br>\nAnd now more apt are others which be able<br>\nTo get within the pores and gender sour.<br>\nBoth sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey—<br>\nWhat oft we’ve proved above to thee before.<br>\nNow come, and I will indicate what wise<br>\nImpact of odour on the nostrils touches.<br>\nAnd first, ‘tis needful there be many things<br>\nFrom whence the streaming flow of varied odours<br>\nMay roll along, and we’re constrained to think<br>\nThey stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about<br>\nImpartially. But for some breathing creatures<br>\nOne odour is more apt, to others another—<br>\nBecause of differing forms of seeds and pores.<br>\nThus on and on along the zephyrs bees<br>\nAre led by odour of honey, vultures too<br>\nBy carcasses. Again, the forward power<br>\nOf scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on<br>\nWhithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast<br>\nHath hastened its career; and the white goose,<br>\nThe saviour of the Roman citadel,<br>\nForescents afar the odour of mankind.<br>\nThus, diversly to divers ones is given<br>\nPeculiar smell that leadeth each along<br>\nTo his own food or makes him start aback<br>\nFrom loathsome poison, and in this wise are<br>\nThe generations of the wild preserved.</p>\n<p>Yet is this pungence not alone in odours<br>\nOr in the class of flavours; but, likewise,<br>\nThe look of things and hues agree not all<br>\nSo well with senses unto all, but that<br>\nSome unto some will be, to gaze upon,<br>\nMore keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,<br>\nThey dare not face and gaze upon the cock<br>\nWho’s wont with wings to flap away the night<br>\nFrom off the stage, and call the beaming morn<br>\nWith clarion voice—and lions straightway thus<br>\nBethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,<br>\nWithin the body of the cocks there be<br>\nSome certain seeds, which, into lions’ eyes<br>\nInjected, bore into the pupils deep<br>\nAnd yield such piercing pain they can’t hold out<br>\nAgainst the cocks, however fierce they be—<br>\nWhilst yet these seeds can’t hurt our gaze the least,<br>\nEither because they do not penetrate,<br>\nOr since they have free exit from the eyes<br>\nAs soon as penetrating, so that thus<br>\nThey cannot hurt our eyes in any part<br>\nBy there remaining.</p>\n<p>                  To speak once more of odour;<br>\nWhatever assail the nostrils, some can travel<br>\nA longer way than others. None of them,<br>\nHowever, ‘s borne so far as sound or voice—<br>\nWhile I omit all mention of such things<br>\nAs hit the eyesight and assail the vision.<br>\nFor slowly on a wandering course it comes<br>\nAnd perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed<br>\nEasily into all the winds of air;—<br>\nAnd first, because from deep inside the thing<br>\nIt is discharged with labour (for the fact<br>\nThat every object, when ‘tis shivered, ground,<br>\nOr crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger<br>\nIs sign that odours flow and part away<br>\nFrom inner regions of the things). And next,<br>\nThou mayest see that odour is create<br>\nOf larger primal germs than voice, because<br>\nIt enters not through stony walls, wherethrough<br>\nUnfailingly the voice and sound are borne;<br>\nWherefore, besides, thou wilt observe ‘tis not<br>\nSo easy to trace out in whatso place<br>\nThe smelling object is. For, dallying on<br>\nAlong the winds, the particles cool off,<br>\nAnd then the scurrying messengers of things<br>\nArrive our senses, when no longer hot.<br>\nSo dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.</p>\n<p>Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,<br>\nAnd learn, in few, whence unto intellect<br>\nDo come what come. And first I tell thee this:<br>\nThat many images of objects rove<br>\nIn many modes to every region round—<br>\nSo thin that easily the one with other,<br>\nWhen once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,<br>\nLike gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,<br>\nFar thinner are they in their fabric than<br>\nThose images which take a hold on eyes<br>\nAnd smite the vision, since through body’s pores<br>\nThey penetrate, and inwardly stir up<br>\nThe subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.<br>\nThus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus<br>\nThe Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,<br>\nAnd images of people gone before—<br>\nDead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;<br>\nBecause the images of every kind<br>\nAre everywhere about us borne—in part<br>\nThose which are gendered in the very air<br>\nOf own accord, in part those others which<br>\nFrom divers things do part away, and those<br>\nWhich are compounded, made from out their shapes.<br>\nFor soothly from no living Centaur is<br>\nThat phantom gendered, since no breed of beast<br>\nLike him was ever; but, when images<br>\nOf horse and man by chance have come together,<br>\nThey easily cohere, as aforesaid,<br>\nAt once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.<br>\nIn the same fashion others of this ilk<br>\nCreated are. And when they’re quickly borne<br>\nIn their exceeding lightness, easily<br>\n(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,<br>\nCompounded, moves by its one blow the mind,<br>\nItself so subtle and so strangely quick.</p>\n<p>That these things come to pass as I record,<br>\nFrom this thou easily canst understand:<br>\nSo far as one is unto other like,<br>\nSeeing with mind as well as with the eyes<br>\nMust come to pass in fashion not unlike.<br>\nWell, now, since I have shown that I perceive<br>\nHaply a lion through those idol-films<br>\nSuch as assail my eyes, ‘tis thine to know<br>\nAlso the mind is in like manner moved,<br>\nAnd sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see<br>\n(Except that it perceives more subtle films)<br>\nThe lion and aught else through idol-films.<br>\nAnd when the sleep has overset our frame,<br>\nThe mind’s intelligence is now awake,<br>\nStill for no other reason, save that these—<br>\nThe self-same films as when we are awake—<br>\nAssail our minds, to such degree indeed<br>\nThat we do seem to see for sure the man<br>\nWhom, void of life, now death and earth have gained<br>\nDominion over. And nature forces this<br>\nTo come to pass because the body’s senses<br>\nAre resting, thwarted through the members all,<br>\nUnable now to conquer false with true;<br>\nAnd memory lies prone and languishes<br>\nIn slumber, nor protests that he, the man<br>\nWhom the mind feigns to see alive, long since<br>\nHath been the gain of death and dissolution.</p>\n<p>And further, ‘tis no marvel idols move<br>\nAnd toss their arms and other members round<br>\nIn rhythmic time—and often in men’s sleeps<br>\nIt haps an image this is seen to do;<br>\nIn sooth, when perishes the former image,<br>\nAnd other is gendered of another pose,<br>\nThat former seemeth to have changed its gestures.<br>\nOf course the change must be conceived as speedy;<br>\nSo great the swiftness and so great the store<br>\nOf idol-things, and (in an instant brief<br>\nAs mind can mark) so great, again, the store<br>\nOf separate idol-parts to bring supplies.</p>\n<p>It happens also that there is supplied<br>\nSometimes an image not of kind the same;<br>\nBut what before was woman, now at hand<br>\nIs seen to stand there, altered into male;<br>\nOr other visage, other age succeeds;<br>\nBut slumber and oblivion take care<br>\nThat we shall feel no wonder at the thing.</p>\n<p>And much in these affairs demands inquiry,<br>\nAnd much, illumination—if we crave<br>\nWith plainness to exhibit facts. And first,<br>\nWhy doth the mind of one to whom the whim<br>\nTo think has come behold forthwith that thing?<br>\nOr do the idols watch upon our will,<br>\nAnd doth an image unto us occur,<br>\nDirectly we desire—if heart prefer<br>\nThe sea, the land, or after all the sky?<br>\nAssemblies of the citizens, parades,<br>\nBanquets, and battles, these and all doth she,<br>\nNature, create and furnish at our word?—<br>\nMaugre the fact that in same place and spot<br>\nAnother’s mind is meditating things<br>\nAll far unlike. And what, again, of this:<br>\nWhen we in sleep behold the idols step,<br>\nIn measure, forward, moving supple limbs,<br>\nWhilst forth they put each supple arm in turn<br>\nWith speedy motion, and with eyeing heads<br>\nRepeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?<br>\nForsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,<br>\nAnd wander to and fro well taught indeed,—<br>\nThus to be able in the time of night<br>\nTo make such games! Or will the truth be this:<br>\nBecause in one least moment that we mark—<br>\nThat is, the uttering of a single sound—<br>\nThere lurk yet many moments, which the reason<br>\nDiscovers to exist, therefore it comes<br>\nThat, in a moment how so brief ye will,<br>\nThe divers idols are hard by, and ready<br>\nEach in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,<br>\nSo great, again, the store of idol-things,<br>\nAnd so, when perishes the former image,<br>\nAnd other is gendered of another pose,<br>\nThe former seemeth to have changed its gestures.<br>\nAnd since they be so tenuous, mind can mark<br>\nSharply alone the ones it strains to see;<br>\nAnd thus the rest do perish one and all,<br>\nSave those for which the mind prepares itself.<br>\nFurther, it doth prepare itself indeed,<br>\nAnd hopes to see what follows after each—<br>\nHence this result. For hast thou not observed<br>\nHow eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,<br>\nWill strain in preparation, otherwise<br>\nUnable sharply to perceive at all?<br>\nYet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,<br>\nIf thou attendest not, ‘tis just the same<br>\nAs if ‘twere all the time removed and far.<br>\nWhat marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,<br>\nSave those to which ‘thas given up itself?<br>\nSo ‘tis that we conjecture from small signs<br>\nThings wide and weighty, and involve ourselves<br>\nIn snarls of self-deceit.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/iv/some-vital-functions/\">BOOK IV - SOME VITAL FUNCTIONS</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom certain things flow odours evermore,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAs cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom waves of ocean, eater-out of walls"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAround the coasts.
