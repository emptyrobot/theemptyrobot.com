Then shall crash<br>\nThat massive form and fabric of the world<br>\nSustained so many aeons! Nor do I<br>\nFail to perceive how strange and marvellous<br>\nThis fact must strike the intellect of man,—<br>\nAnnihilation of the sky and earth<br>\nThat is to be,—and with what toil of words<br>\n‘Tis mine to prove the same; as happens oft<br>\nWhen once ye offer to man’s listening ears<br>\nSomething before unheard of, but may not<br>\nSubject it to the view of eyes for him<br>\nNor put it into hand—the sight and touch,<br>\nWhereby the opened highways of belief<br>\nLead most directly into human breast<br>\nAnd regions of intelligence. But yet<br>\nI will speak out. The fact itself, perchance,<br>\nWill force belief in these my words, and thou<br>\nMayst see, in little time, tremendously<br>\nWith risen commotions of the lands all things<br>\nQuaking to pieces—which afar from us<br>\nMay she, the steersman Nature, guide: and may<br>\nReason, O rather than the fact itself,<br>\nPersuade us that all things can be o’erthrown<br>\nAnd sink with awful-sounding breakage down!</p>\n<p>But ere on this I take a step to utter<br>\nOracles holier and soundlier based<br>\nThan ever the Pythian pronounced for men<br>\nFrom out the tripod and the Delphian laurel,<br>\nI will unfold for thee with learned words<br>\nMany a consolation, lest perchance,<br>\nStill bridled by religion, thou suppose<br>\nLands, sun, and sky, sea, constellations, moon,<br>\nMust dure forever, as of frame divine—<br>\nAnd so conclude that it is just that those,<br>\n(After the manner of the Giants), should all<br>\nPay the huge penalties for monstrous crime,<br>\nWho by their reasonings do overshake<br>\nThe ramparts of the universe and wish<br>\nThere to put out the splendid sun of heaven,<br>\nBranding with mortal talk immortal things—<br>\nThough these same things are even so far removed<br>\nFrom any touch of deity and seem<br>\nSo far unworthy of numbering with the gods,<br>\nThat well they may be thought to furnish rather<br>\nA goodly instance of the sort of things<br>\nThat lack the living motion, living sense.<br>\nFor sure ‘tis quite beside the mark to think<br>\nThat judgment and the nature of the mind<br>\nIn any kind of body can exist—<br>\nJust as in ether can’t exist a tree,<br>\nNor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields<br>\nCan fishes live, nor blood in timber be,<br>\nNor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged<br>\nWhere everything may grow and have its place.<br>\nThus nature of mind cannot arise alone<br>\nWithout the body, nor have its being far<br>\nFrom thews and blood. Yet if ‘twere possible?—<br>\nMuch rather might this very power of mind<br>\nBe in the head, the shoulders, or the heels,<br>\nAnd, born in any part soever, yet<br>\nIn the same man, in the same vessel abide<br>\nBut since within this body even of ours<br>\nStands fixed and appears arranged sure<br>\nWhere soul and mind can each exist and grow,<br>\nDeny we must the more that they can dure<br>\nOutside the body and the breathing form<br>\nIn rotting clods of earth, in the sun’s fire,<br>\nIn water, or in ether’s skiey coasts.<br>\nTherefore these things no whit are furnished<br>\nWith sense divine, since never can they be<br>\nWith life-force quickened.</p>\n<p>                      Likewise, thou canst ne’er<br>\nBelieve the sacred seats of gods are here<br>\nIn any regions of this mundane world;<br>\nIndeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle,<br>\nSo far removed from these our senses, scarce<br>\nIs seen even by intelligence of mind.<br>\nAnd since they’ve ever eluded touch and thrust<br>\nOf human hands, they cannot reach to grasp<br>\nAught tangible to us. For what may not<br>\nItself be touched in turn can never touch.<br>\nWherefore, besides, also their seats must be<br>\nUnlike these seats of ours,—even subtle too,<br>\nAs meet for subtle essence—as I’ll prove<br>\nHereafter unto thee with large discourse.<br>\nFurther, to say that for the sake of men<br>\nThey willed to prepare this world’s magnificence,<br>\nAnd that ‘tis therefore duty and behoof<br>\nTo praise the work of gods as worthy praise,<br>\nAnd that ‘tis sacrilege for men to shake<br>\nEver by any force from out their seats<br>\nWhat hath been stablished by the Forethought old<br>\nTo everlasting for races of mankind,<br>\nAnd that ‘tis sacrilege to assault by words<br>\nAnd overtopple all from base to beam,—<br>\nMemmius, such notions to concoct and pile,<br>\nIs verily—to dote. Our gratefulness,<br>\nO what emoluments could it confer<br>\nUpon Immortals and upon the Blessed<br>\nThat they should take a step to manage aught<br>\nFor sake of us? Or what new factor could,<br>\nAfter so long a time, inveigle them—<br>\nThe hitherto reposeful—to desire<br>\nTo change their former life? For rather he<br>\nWhom old things chafe seems likely to rejoice<br>\nAt new; but one that in fore-passed time<br>\nHath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years,<br>\nO what could ever enkindle in such an one<br>\nPassion for strange experiment? Or what<br>\nThe evil for us, if we had ne’er been born?—<br>\nAs though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe<br>\nOur life were lying till should dawn at last<br>\nThe day-spring of creation! Whosoever<br>\nHath been begotten wills perforce to stay<br>\nIn life, so long as fond delight detains;<br>\nBut whoso ne’er hath tasted love of life,<br>\nAnd ne’er was in the count of living things,<br>\nWhat hurts it him that he was never born?<br>\nWhence, further, first was planted in the gods<br>\nThe archetype for gendering the world<br>\nAnd the fore-notion of what man is like,<br>\nSo that they knew and pre-conceived with mind<br>\nJust what they wished to make? Or how were known<br>\nEver the energies of primal germs,<br>\nAnd what those germs, by interchange of place,<br>\nCould thus produce, if nature’s self had not<br>\nGiven example for creating all?<br>\nFor in such wise primordials of things,<br>\nMany in many modes, astir by blows<br>\nFrom immemorial aeons, in motion too<br>\nBy their own weights, have evermore been wont<br>\nTo be so borne along and in all modes<br>\nTo meet together and to try all sorts<br>\nWhich, by combining one with other, they<br>\nAre powerful to create, that thus it is<br>\nNo marvel now, if they have also fallen<br>\nInto arrangements such, and if they’ve passed<br>\nInto vibrations such, as those whereby<br>\nThis sum of things is carried on to-day<br>\nBy fixed renewal. But knew I never what<br>\nThe seeds primordial were, yet would I dare<br>\nThis to affirm, even from deep judgments based<br>\nUpon the ways and conduct of the skies—<br>\nThis to maintain by many a fact besides—<br>\nThat in no wise the nature of all things<br>\nFor us was fashioned by a power divine—<br>\nSo great the faults it stands encumbered with.<br>\nFirst, mark all regions which are overarched<br>\nBy the prodigious reaches of the sky:<br>\nOne yawning part thereof the mountain-chains<br>\nAnd forests of the beasts do have and hold;<br>\nAnd cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea<br>\n(Which sunder afar the beaches of the lands)<br>\nPossess it merely; and, again, thereof<br>\nWell-nigh two-thirds intolerable heat<br>\nAnd a perpetual fall of frost doth rob<br>\nFrom mortal kind. And what is left to till,<br>\nEven that the force of nature would o’errun<br>\nWith brambles, did not human force oppose,—<br>\nLong wont for livelihood to groan and sweat<br>\nOver the two-pronged mattock and to cleave<br>\nThe soil in twain by pressing on the plough.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Unless, by the ploughshare turning the fruitful clods<br>\nAnd kneading the mould, we quicken into birth,<br>\n[The crops] spontaneously could not come up<br>\nInto the free bright air. Even then sometimes,<br>\nWhen things acquired by the sternest toil<br>\nAre now in leaf, are now in blossom all,<br>\nEither the skiey sun with baneful heats<br>\nParches, or sudden rains or chilling rime<br>\nDestroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl<br>\nTorment and twist. Beside these matters, why<br>\nDoth nature feed and foster on land and sea<br>\nThe dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes<br>\nOf the human clan? Why do the seasons bring<br>\nDistempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large<br>\nDeath, so untimely? Then, again, the babe,<br>\nLike to the castaway of the raging surf,<br>\nLies naked on the ground, speechless, in want<br>\nOf every help for life, when nature first<br>\nHath poured him forth upon the shores of light<br>\nWith birth-pangs from within the mother’s womb,<br>\nAnd with a plaintive wail he fills the place,—<br>\nAs well befitting one for whom remains<br>\nIn life a journey through so many ills.<br>\nBut all the flocks and herds and all wild beasts<br>\nCome forth and grow, nor need the little rattles,<br>\nNor must be treated to the humouring nurse’s<br>\nDear, broken chatter; nor seek they divers clothes<br>\nTo suit the changing skies; nor need, in fine,<br>\nNor arms, nor lofty ramparts, wherewithal<br>\nTheir own to guard—because the earth herself<br>\nAnd nature, artificer of the world, bring forth<br>\nAboundingly all things for all.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/v/the-world-is-not-eternal/\">BOOK V - THE WORLD IS NOT ETERNAL</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                           And walking now"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn his own footprints, I do follow through"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nHis reasonings, and with pronouncements teach"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe covenant whereby all things are framed,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nHow under that covenant they must abide"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNor ever prevail to abrogate the aeons’"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nInexorable decrees,—how (as we’ve found),"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn class of mortal objects, o’er all else,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe mind exists of earth-born frame create"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd impotent unscathed to abide"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAcross the mighty aeons, and how come"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn sleep those idol-apparitions,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThat so befool intelligence when we"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nDo seem to view a man whom life has left."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThus far we’ve gone;
