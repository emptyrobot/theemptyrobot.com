For ‘twas now that fire<br>\nRendered their shivering frames less staunch to bear,<br>\nUnder the canopy of the sky, the cold;<br>\nAnd Love reduced their shaggy hardiness;<br>\nAnd children, with the prattle and the kiss,<br>\nSoon broke the parents’ haughty temper down.<br>\nThen, too, did neighbours ‘gin to league as friends,<br>\nEager to wrong no more or suffer wrong,<br>\nAnd urged for children and the womankind<br>\nMercy, of fathers, whilst with cries and gestures<br>\nThey stammered hints how meet it was that all<br>\nShould have compassion on the weak. And still,<br>\nThough concord not in every wise could then<br>\nBegotten be, a good, a goodly part<br>\nKept faith inviolate—or else mankind<br>\nLong since had been unutterably cut off,<br>\nAnd propagation never could have brought<br>\nThe species down the ages.</p>\n<p>                      Lest, perchance,<br>\nConcerning these affairs thou ponderest<br>\nIn silent meditation, let me say<br>\n‘Twas lightning brought primevally to earth<br>\nThe fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread<br>\nO’er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus<br>\nEven now we see so many objects, touched<br>\nBy the celestial flames, to flash aglow,<br>\nWhen thunderbolt has dowered them with heat.<br>\nYet also when a many-branched tree,<br>\nBeaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,<br>\nPressing ‘gainst branches of a neighbour tree,<br>\nThere by the power of mighty rub and rub<br>\nIs fire engendered; and at times out-flares<br>\nThe scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe<br>\nAgainst the trunks. And of these causes, either<br>\nMay well have given to mortal men the fire.<br>\nNext, food to cook and soften in the flame<br>\nThe sun instructed, since so oft they saw<br>\nHow objects mellowed, when subdued by warmth<br>\nAnd by the raining blows of fiery beams,<br>\nThrough all the fields.</p>\n<p>                    And more and more each day<br>\nWould men more strong in sense, more wise in heart,<br>\nTeach them to change their earlier mode and life<br>\nBy fire and new devices. Kings began<br>\nCities to found and citadels to set,<br>\nAs strongholds and asylums for themselves,<br>\nAnd flocks and fields to portion for each man<br>\nAfter the beauty, strength, and sense of each—<br>\nFor beauty then imported much, and strength<br>\nHad its own rights supreme. Thereafter, wealth<br>\nDiscovered was, and gold was brought to light,<br>\nWhich soon of honour stripped both strong and fair;<br>\nFor men, however beautiful in form<br>\nOr valorous, will follow in the main<br>\nThe rich man’s party. Yet were man to steer<br>\nHis life by sounder reasoning, he’d own<br>\nAbounding riches, if with mind content<br>\nHe lived by thrift; for never, as I guess,<br>\nIs there a lack of little in the world.<br>\nBut men wished glory for themselves and power<br>\nEven that their fortunes on foundations firm<br>\nMight rest forever, and that they themselves,<br>\nThe opulent, might pass a quiet life—<br>\nIn vain, in vain; since, in the strife to climb<br>\nOn to the heights of honour, men do make<br>\nTheir pathway terrible; and even when once<br>\nThey reach them, envy like the thunderbolt<br>\nAt times will smite, O hurling headlong down<br>\nTo murkiest Tartarus, in scorn; for, lo,<br>\nAll summits, all regions loftier than the rest,<br>\nSmoke, blasted as by envy’s thunderbolts;<br>\nSo better far in quiet to obey,<br>\nThan to desire chief mastery of affairs<br>\nAnd ownership of empires. Be it so;<br>\nAnd let the weary sweat their life-blood out<br>\nAll to no end, battling in hate along<br>\nThe narrow path of man’s ambition;<br>\nSince all their wisdom is from others’ lips,<br>\nAnd all they seek is known from what they’ve heard<br>\nAnd less from what they’ve thought. Nor is this folly<br>\nGreater to-day, nor greater soon to be,<br>\nThan’ twas of old.</p>\n<p>               And therefore kings were slain,<br>\nAnd pristine majesty of golden thrones<br>\nAnd haughty sceptres lay o’erturned in dust;<br>\nAnd crowns, so splendid on the sovereign heads,<br>\nSoon bloody under the proletarian feet,<br>\nGroaned for their glories gone—for erst o’er-much<br>\nDreaded, thereafter with more greedy zest<br>\nTrampled beneath the rabble heel. Thus things<br>\nDown to the vilest lees of brawling mobs<br>\nSuccumbed, whilst each man sought unto himself<br>\nDominion and supremacy. So next<br>\nSome wiser heads instructed men to found<br>\nThe magisterial office, and did frame<br>\nCodes that they might consent to follow laws.<br>\nFor humankind, o’er wearied with a life<br>\nFostered by force, was ailing from its feuds;<br>\nAnd so the sooner of its own free will<br>\nYielded to laws and strictest codes. For since<br>\nEach hand made ready in its wrath to take<br>\nA vengeance fiercer than by man’s fair laws<br>\nIs now conceded, men on this account<br>\nLoathed the old life fostered by force. ‘Tis thence<br>\nThat fear of punishments defiles each prize<br>\nOf wicked days; for force and fraud ensnare<br>\nEach man around, and in the main recoil<br>\nOn him from whence they sprung. Not easy ‘tis<br>\nFor one who violates by ugly deeds<br>\nThe bonds of common peace to pass a life<br>\nComposed and tranquil. For albeit he ‘scape<br>\nThe race of gods and men, he yet must dread<br>\n‘Twill not be hid forever—since, indeed,<br>\nSo many, oft babbling on amid their dreams<br>\nOr raving in sickness, have betrayed themselves<br>\n(As stories tell) and published at last<br>\nOld secrets and the sins.</p>\n<p>                        But nature ‘twas<br>\nUrged men to utter various sounds of tongue<br>\nAnd need and use did mould the names of things,<br>\nAbout in same wise as the lack-speech years<br>\nCompel young children unto gesturings,<br>\nMaking them point with finger here and there<br>\nAt what’s before them. For each creature feels<br>\nBy instinct to what use to put his powers.<br>\nEre yet the bull-calf’s scarce begotten horns<br>\nProject above his brows, with them he ‘gins<br>\nEnraged to butt and savagely to thrust.<br>\nBut whelps of panthers and the lion’s cubs<br>\nWith claws and paws and bites are at the fray<br>\nAlready, when their teeth and claws be scarce<br>\nAs yet engendered. So again, we see<br>\nAll breeds of winged creatures trust to wings<br>\nAnd from their fledgling pinions seek to get<br>\nA fluttering assistance. Thus, to think<br>\nThat in those days some man apportioned round<br>\nTo things their names, and that from him men learned<br>\nTheir first nomenclature, is foolery.<br>\nFor why could he mark everything by words<br>\nAnd utter the various sounds of tongue, what time<br>\nThe rest may be supposed powerless<br>\nTo do the same? And, if the rest had not<br>\nAlready one with other used words,<br>\nWhence was implanted in the teacher, then,<br>\nFore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given<br>\nTo him alone primordial faculty<br>\nTo know and see in mind what ‘twas he willed?<br>\nBesides, one only man could scarce subdue<br>\nAn overmastered multitude to choose<br>\nTo get by heart his names of things. A task<br>\nNot easy ‘tis in any wise to teach<br>\nAnd to persuade the deaf concerning what<br>\n‘Tis needful for to do. For ne’er would they<br>\nAllow, nor ne’er in anywise endure<br>\nPerpetual vain dingdong in their ears<br>\nOf spoken sounds unheard before. And what,<br>\nAt last, in this affair so wondrous is,<br>\nThat human race (in whom a voice and tongue<br>\nWere now in vigour) should by divers words<br>\nDenote its objects, as each divers sense<br>\nMight prompt?—since even the speechless herds, aye, since<br>\nThe very generations of wild beasts<br>\nAre wont dissimilar and divers sounds<br>\nTo rouse from in them, when there’s fear or pain,<br>\nAnd when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth,<br>\n‘Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first<br>\nHuge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds,<br>\nBaring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl,<br>\nThey threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back,<br>\nIn sounds far other than with which they bark<br>\nAnd fill with voices all the regions round.<br>\nAnd when with fondling tongue they start to lick<br>\nTheir puppies, or do toss them round with paws,<br>\nFeigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,<br>\nThey fawn with yelps of voice far other then<br>\nThan when, alone within the house, they bay,<br>\nOr whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.<br>\nAgain the neighing of the horse, is that<br>\nNot seen to differ likewise, when the stud<br>\nIn buoyant flower of his young years raves,<br>\nGoaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,<br>\nAnd when with widening nostrils out he snorts<br>\nThe call to battle, and when haply he<br>\nWhinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?<br>\nLastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,<br>\nHawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life<br>\nAmid the ocean billows in the brine,<br>\nUtter at other times far other cries<br>\nThan when they fight for food, or with their prey<br>\nStruggle and strain. And birds there are which change<br>\nWith changing weather their own raucous songs—<br>\nAs long-lived generations of the crows<br>\nOr flocks of rooks, when they be said to cry<br>\nFor rain and water and to call at times<br>\nFor winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods<br>\nCompel the brutes, though speechless evermore,<br>\nTo send forth divers sounds, O truly then<br>\nHow much more likely ‘twere that mortal men<br>\nIn those days could with many a different sound<br>\nDenote each separate thing.</p>\n<p>                         And now what cause<br>\nHath spread divinities of gods abroad<br>\nThrough mighty nations, and filled the cities full<br>\nOf the high altars, and led to practices<br>\nOf solemn rites in season—rites which still<br>\nFlourish in midst of great affairs of state<br>\nAnd midst great centres of man’s civic life,<br>\nThe rites whence still a poor mortality<br>\nIs grafted that quaking awe which rears aloft<br>\nStill the new temples of gods from land to land<br>\nAnd drives mankind to visit them in throngs<br>\nOn holy days—‘tis not so hard to give<br>\nReason thereof in speech. Because, in sooth,<br>\nEven in those days would the race of man<br>\nBe seeing excelling visages of gods<br>\nWith mind awake; and in his sleeps, yet more—<br>\nBodies of wondrous growth. And, thus, to these<br>\nWould men attribute sense, because they seemed<br>\nTo move their limbs and speak pronouncements high,<br>\nBefitting glorious visage and vast powers.<br>\nAnd men would give them an eternal life,<br>\nBecause their visages forevermore<br>\nWere there before them, and their shapes remained,<br>\nAnd chiefly, however, because men would not think<br>\nBeings augmented with such mighty powers<br>\nCould well by any force o’ermastered be.<br>\nAnd men would think them in their happiness<br>\nExcelling far, because the fear of death<br>\nVexed no one of them at all, and since<br>\nAt same time in men’s sleeps men saw them do<br>\nSo many wonders, and yet feel therefrom<br>\nThemselves no weariness. Besides, men marked<br>\nHow in a fixed order rolled around<br>\nThe systems of the sky, and changed times<br>\nOf annual seasons, nor were able then<br>\nTo know thereof the causes. Therefore ‘twas<br>\nMen would take refuge in consigning all<br>\nUnto divinities, and in feigning all<br>\nWas guided by their nod. And in the sky<br>\nThey set the seats and vaults of gods, because<br>\nAcross the sky night and the moon are seen<br>\nTo roll along—moon, day, and night, and night’s<br>\nOld awesome constellations evermore,<br>\nAnd the night-wandering fireballs of the sky,<br>\nAnd flying flames, clouds, and the sun, the rains,<br>\nSnow and the winds, the lightnings, and the hail,<br>\nAnd the swift rumblings, and the hollow roar<br>\nOf mighty menacings forevermore.</p>\n<p>O humankind unhappy!—when it ascribed<br>\nUnto divinities such awesome deeds,<br>\nAnd coupled thereto rigours of fierce wrath!<br>\nWhat groans did men on that sad day beget<br>\nEven for themselves, and O what wounds for us,<br>\nWhat tears for our children’s children! Nor, O man,<br>\nIs thy true piety in this: with head<br>\nUnder the veil, still to be seen to turn<br>\nFronting a stone, and ever to approach<br>\nUnto all altars; nor so prone on earth<br>\nForward to fall, to spread upturned palms<br>\nBefore the shrines of gods, nor yet to dew<br>\nAltars with profuse blood of four-foot beasts,<br>\nNor vows with vows to link. But rather this:<br>\nTo look on all things with a master eye<br>\nAnd mind at peace. For when we gaze aloft<br>\nUpon the skiey vaults of yon great world<br>\nAnd ether, fixed high o’er twinkling stars,<br>\nAnd into our thought there come the journeyings<br>\nOf sun and moon, O then into our breasts,<br>\nO’erburdened already with their other ills,<br>\nBegins forthwith to rear its sudden head<br>\nOne more misgiving: lest o’er us, percase,<br>\nIt be the gods’ immeasurable power<br>\nThat rolls, with varied motion, round and round<br>\nThe far white constellations. For the lack<br>\nOf aught of reasons tries the puzzled mind:<br>\nWhether was ever a birth-time of the world,<br>\nAnd whether, likewise, any end shall be<br>\nHow far the ramparts of the world can still<br>\nOutstand this strain of ever-roused motion,<br>\nOr whether, divinely with eternal weal<br>\nEndowed, they can through endless tracts of age<br>\nGlide on, defying the o’er-mighty powers<br>\nOf the immeasurable ages. Lo,<br>\nWhat man is there whose mind with dread of gods<br>\nCringes not close, whose limbs with terror-spell<br>\nCrouch not together, when the parched earth<br>\nQuakes with the horrible thunderbolt amain,<br>\nAnd across the mighty sky the rumblings run?<br>\nDo not the peoples and the nations shake,<br>\nAnd haughty kings do they not hug their limbs,<br>\nStrook through with fear of the divinities,<br>\nLest for aught foully done or madly said<br>\nThe heavy time be now at hand to pay?<br>\nWhen, too, fierce force of fury-winds at sea<br>\nSweepeth a navy’s admiral down the main<br>\nWith his stout legions and his elephants,<br>\nDoth he not seek the peace of gods with vows,<br>\nAnd beg in prayer, a-tremble, lulled winds<br>\nAnd friendly gales?—in vain, since, often up-caught<br>\nIn fury-cyclones, is he borne along,<br>\nFor all his mouthings, to the shoals of doom.<br>\nAh, so irrevocably some hidden power<br>\nBetramples forevermore affairs of men,<br>\nAnd visibly grindeth with its heel in mire<br>\nThe lictors’ glorious rods and axes dire,<br>\nHaving them in derision! Again, when earth<br>\nFrom end to end is rocking under foot,<br>\nAnd shaken cities ruin down, or threaten<br>\nUpon the verge, what wonder is it then<br>\nThat mortal generations abase themselves,<br>\nAnd unto gods in all affairs of earth<br>\nAssign as last resort almighty powers<br>\nAnd wondrous energies to govern all?</p>\n<p>Now for the rest: copper and gold and iron<br>\nDiscovered were, and with them silver’s weight<br>\nAnd power of lead, when with prodigious heat<br>\nThe conflagrations burned the forest trees<br>\nAmong the mighty mountains, by a bolt<br>\nOf lightning from the sky, or else because<br>\nMen, warring in the woodlands, on their foes<br>\nHad hurled fire to frighten and dismay,<br>\nOr yet because, by goodness of the soil<br>\nInvited, men desired to clear rich fields<br>\nAnd turn the countryside to pasture-lands,<br>\nOr slay the wild and thrive upon the spoils.<br>\n(For hunting by pit-fall and by fire arose<br>\nBefore the art of hedging the covert round<br>\nWith net or stirring it with dogs of chase.)<br>\nHowso the fact, and from what cause soever<br>\nThe flamy heat with awful crack and roar<br>\nHad there devoured to their deepest roots<br>\nThe forest trees and baked the earth with fire,<br>\nThen from the boiling veins began to ooze<br>\nO rivulets of silver and of gold,<br>\nOf lead and copper too, collecting soon<br>\nInto the hollow places of the ground.<br>\nAnd when men saw the cooled lumps anon<br>\nTo shine with splendour-sheen upon the ground,<br>\nMuch taken with that lustrous smooth delight,<br>\nThey ‘gan to pry them out, and saw how each<br>\nHad got a shape like to its earthy mould.<br>\nThen would it enter their heads how these same lumps,<br>\nIf melted by heat, could into any form<br>\nOr figure of things be run, and how, again,<br>\nIf hammered out, they could be nicely drawn<br>\nTo sharpest points or finest edge, and thus<br>\nYield to the forgers tools and give them power<br>\nTo chop the forest down, to hew the logs,<br>\nTo shave the beams and planks, besides to bore<br>\nAnd punch and drill. And men began such work<br>\nAt first as much with tools of silver and gold<br>\nAs with the impetuous strength of the stout copper;<br>\nBut vainly—since their over-mastered power<br>\nWould soon give way, unable to endure,<br>\nLike copper, such hard labour. In those days<br>\nCopper it was that was the thing of price;<br>\nAnd gold lay useless, blunted with dull edge.<br>\nNow lies the copper low, and gold hath come<br>\nUnto the loftiest honours. Thus it is<br>\nThat rolling ages change the times of things:<br>\nWhat erst was of a price, becomes at last<br>\nA discard of no honour; whilst another<br>\nSucceeds to glory, issuing from contempt,<br>\nAnd day by day is sought for more and more,<br>\nAnd, when ‘tis found, doth flower in men’s praise,<br>\nObjects of wondrous honour.</p>\n<p>                          Now, Memmius,<br>\nHow nature of iron discovered was, thou mayst<br>\nOf thine own self divine. Man’s ancient arms<br>\nWere hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs—<br>\nBreakage of forest trees—and flame and fire,<br>\nAs soon as known. Thereafter force of iron<br>\nAnd copper discovered was; and copper’s use<br>\nWas known ere iron’s, since more tractable<br>\nIts nature is and its abundance more.<br>\nWith copper men to work the soil began,<br>\nWith copper to rouse the hurly waves of war,<br>\nTo straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away<br>\nAnother’s flocks and fields. For unto them,<br>\nThus armed, all things naked of defence<br>\nReadily yielded. Then by slow degrees<br>\nThe sword of iron succeeded, and the shape<br>\nOf brazen sickle into scorn was turned:<br>\nWith iron to cleave the soil of earth they ‘gan,<br>\nAnd the contentions of uncertain war<br>\nWere rendered equal.</p>\n<p>                  And, lo, man was wont<br>\nArmed to mount upon the ribs of horse<br>\nAnd guide him with the rein, and play about<br>\nWith right hand free, oft times before he tried<br>\nPerils of war in yoked chariot;<br>\nAnd yoked pairs abreast came earlier<br>\nThan yokes of four, or scythed chariots<br>\nWhereinto clomb the men-at-arms. And next<br>\nThe Punic folk did train the elephants—<br>\nThose curst Lucanian oxen, hideous,<br>\nThe serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks—<br>\nTo dure the wounds of war and panic-strike<br>\nThe mighty troops of Mars. Thus Discord sad<br>\nBegat the one Thing after other, to be<br>\nThe terror of the nations under arms,<br>\nAnd day by day to horrors of old war<br>\nShe added an increase.</p>\n<p>                   Bulls, too, they tried<br>\nIn war’s grim business; and essayed to send<br>\nOutrageous boars against the foes. And some<br>\nSent on before their ranks puissant lions<br>\nWith armed trainers and with masters fierce<br>\nTo guide and hold in chains—and yet in vain,<br>\nSince fleshed with pell-mell slaughter, fierce they flew,<br>\nAnd blindly through the squadrons havoc wrought,<br>\nShaking the frightful crests upon their heads,<br>\nNow here, now there. Nor could the horsemen calm<br>\nTheir horses, panic-breasted at the roar,<br>\nAnd rein them round to front the foe. With spring<br>\nThe infuriate she-lions would up-leap<br>\nNow here, now there; and whoso came apace<br>\nAgainst them, these they’d rend across the face;<br>\nAnd others unwitting from behind they’d tear<br>\nDown from their mounts, and twining round them, bring<br>\nTumbling to earth, o’ermastered by the wound,<br>\nAnd with those powerful fangs and hooked claws<br>\nFasten upon them. Bulls would toss their friends,<br>\nAnd trample under foot, and from beneath<br>\nRip flanks and bellies of horses with their horns,<br>\nAnd with a threat’ning forehead jam the sod;<br>\nAnd boars would gore with stout tusks their allies,<br>\nSplashing in fury their own blood on spears<br>\nSplintered in their own bodies, and would fell<br>\nIn rout and ruin infantry and horse.<br>\nFor there the beasts-of-saddle tried to scape<br>\nThe savage thrusts of tusk by shying off,<br>\nOr rearing up with hoofs a-paw in air.<br>\nIn vain—since there thou mightest see them sink,<br>\nTheir sinews severed, and with heavy fall<br>\nBestrew the ground. And such of these as men<br>\nSupposed well-trained long ago at home,<br>\nWere in the thick of action seen to foam<br>\nIn fury, from the wounds, the shrieks, the flight,<br>\nThe panic, and the tumult; nor could men<br>\nAught of their numbers rally. For each breed<br>\nAnd various of the wild beasts fled apart<br>\nHither or thither, as often in wars to-day<br>\nFlee those Lucanian oxen, by the steel<br>\nGrievously mangled, after they have wrought<br>\nUpon their friends so many a dreadful doom.<br>\n(If ‘twas, indeed, that thus they did at all:<br>\nBut scarcely I’ll believe that men could not<br>\nWith mind foreknow and see, as sure to come,<br>\nSuch foul and general disaster.—This<br>\nWe, then, may hold as true in the great All,<br>\nIn divers worlds on divers plan create,—<br>\nSomewhere afar more likely than upon<br>\nOne certain earth.) But men chose this to do<br>\nLess in the hope of conquering than to give<br>\nTheir enemies a goodly cause of woe,<br>\nEven though thereby they perished themselves,<br>\nSince weak in numbers and since wanting arms.</p>\n<p>Now, clothes of roughly inter-plaited strands<br>\nWere earlier than loom-wove coverings;<br>\nThe loom-wove later than man’s iron is,<br>\nSince iron is needful in the weaving art,<br>\nNor by no other means can there be wrought<br>\nSuch polished tools—the treadles, spindles, shuttles,<br>\nAnd sounding yarn-beams. And nature forced the men,<br>\nBefore the woman kind, to work the wool:<br>\nFor all the male kind far excels in skill,<br>\nAnd cleverer is by much—until at last<br>\nThe rugged farmer folk jeered at such tasks,<br>\nAnd so were eager soon to give them o’er<br>\nTo women’s hands, and in more hardy toil<br>\nTo harden arms and hands.</p>\n<p>                   But nature herself,<br>\nMother of things, was the first seed-sower<br>\nAnd primal grafter; since the berries and acorns,<br>\nDropping from off the trees, would there beneath<br>\nPut forth in season swarms of little shoots;<br>\nHence too men’s fondness for ingrafting slips<br>\nUpon the boughs and setting out in holes<br>\nThe young shrubs o’er the fields. Then would they try<br>\nEver new modes of tilling their loved crofts,<br>\nAnd mark they would how earth improved the taste<br>\nOf the wild fruits by fond and fostering care.<br>\nAnd day by day they’d force the woods to move<br>\nStill higher up the mountain, and to yield<br>\nThe place below for tilth, that there they might,<br>\nOn plains and uplands, have their meadow-plats,<br>\nCisterns and runnels, crops of standing grain,<br>\nAnd happy vineyards, and that all along<br>\nO’er hillocks, intervales, and plains might run<br>\nThe silvery-green belt of olive-trees,<br>\nMarking the plotted landscape; even as now<br>\nThou seest so marked with varied loveliness<br>\nAll the terrain which men adorn and plant<br>\nWith rows of goodly fruit-trees and hedge round<br>\nWith thriving shrubberies sown.</p>\n<p>                             But by the mouth<br>\nTo imitate the liquid notes of birds<br>\nWas earlier far ‘mongst men than power to make,<br>\nBy measured song, melodious verse and give<br>\nDelight to ears. And whistlings of the wind<br>\nAthrough the hollows of the reeds first taught<br>\nThe peasantry to blow into the stalks<br>\nOf hollow hemlock-herb. Then bit by bit<br>\nThey learned sweet plainings, such as pipe out-pours,<br>\nBeaten by finger-tips of singing men,<br>\nWhen heard through unpathed groves and forest deeps<br>\nAnd woodsy meadows, through the untrod haunts<br>\nOf shepherd folk and spots divinely still.<br>\nThus time draws forward each and everything<br>\nLittle by little unto the midst of men,<br>\nAnd reason uplifts it to the shores of light.<br>\nThese tunes would soothe and glad the minds of mortals<br>\nWhen sated with food,—for songs are welcome then.<br>\nAnd often, lounging with friends in the soft grass<br>\nBeside a river of water, underneath<br>\nA big tree’s branches, merrily they’d refresh<br>\nTheir frames, with no vast outlay—most of all<br>\nIf the weather were smiling and the times of the year<br>\nWere painting the green of the grass around with flowers.<br>\nThen jokes, then talk, then peals of jollity<br>\nWould circle round; for then the rustic muse<br>\nWas in her glory; then would antic Mirth<br>\nPrompt them to garland head and shoulders about<br>\nWith chaplets of intertwined flowers and leaves,<br>\nAnd to dance onward, out of tune, with limbs<br>\nClownishly swaying, and with clownish foot<br>\nTo beat our mother earth—from whence arose<br>\nLaughter and peals of jollity, for, lo,<br>\nSuch frolic acts were in their glory then,<br>\nBeing more new and strange. And wakeful men<br>\nFound solaces for their unsleeping hours<br>\nIn drawing forth variety of notes,<br>\nIn modulating melodies, in running<br>\nWith puckered lips along the tuned reeds,<br>\nWhence, even in our day do the watchmen guard<br>\nThese old traditions, and have learned well<br>\nTo keep true measure. And yet they no whit<br>\nDo get a larger fruit of gladsomeness<br>\nThan got the woodland aborigines<br>\nIn olden times. For what we have at hand—<br>\nIf theretofore naught sweeter we have known—<br>\nThat chiefly pleases and seems best of all;<br>\nBut then some later, likely better, find<br>\nDestroys its worth and changes our desires<br>\nRegarding good of yesterday.</p>\n<p>                            And thus<br>\nBegan the loathing of the acorn; thus<br>\nAbandoned were those beds with grasses strewn<br>\nAnd with the leaves beladen. Thus, again,<br>\nFell into new contempt the pelts of beasts—<br>\nErstwhile a robe of honour, which, I guess,<br>\nAroused in those days envy so malign<br>\nThat the first wearer went to woeful death<br>\nBy ambuscades,—and yet that hairy prize,<br>\nRent into rags by greedy foemen there<br>\nAnd splashed by blood, was ruined utterly<br>\nBeyond all use or vantage. Thus of old<br>\n‘Twas pelts, and of to-day ‘tis purple and gold<br>\nThat cark men’s lives with cares and weary with war.<br>\nWherefore, methinks, resides the greater blame<br>\nWith us vain men to-day: for cold would rack,<br>\nWithout their pelts, the naked sons of earth;<br>\nBut us it nothing hurts to do without<br>\nThe purple vestment, broidered with gold<br>\nAnd with imposing figures, if we still<br>\nMake shift with some mean garment of the Plebs.<br>\nSo man in vain futilities toils on<br>\nForever and wastes in idle cares his years—<br>\nBecause, of very truth, he hath not learnt<br>\nWhat the true end of getting is, nor yet<br>\nAt all how far true pleasure may increase.<br>\nAnd ‘tis desire for better and for more<br>\nHath carried by degrees mortality<br>\nOut onward to the deep, and roused up<br>\nFrom the far bottom mighty waves of war.</p>\n<p>But sun and moon, those watchmen of the world,<br>\nWith their own lanterns traversing around<br>\nThe mighty, the revolving vault, have taught<br>\nUnto mankind that seasons of the years<br>\nReturn again, and that the Thing takes place<br>\nAfter a fixed plan and order fixed.</p>\n<p>Already would they pass their life, hedged round<br>\nBy the strong towers; and cultivate an earth<br>\nAll portioned out and boundaried; already<br>\nWould the sea flower and sail-winged ships;<br>\nAlready men had, under treaty pacts,<br>\nConfederates and allies, when poets began<br>\nTo hand heroic actions down in verse;<br>\nNor long ere this had letters been devised—<br>\nHence is our age unable to look back<br>\nOn what has gone before, except where reason<br>\nShows us a footprint.</p>\n<p>                    Sailings on the seas,<br>\nTillings of fields, walls, laws, and arms, and roads,<br>\nDress and the like, all prizes, all delights<br>\nOf finer life, poems, pictures, chiselled shapes<br>\nOf polished sculptures—all these arts were learned<br>\nBy practice and the mind’s experience,<br>\nAs men walked forward step by eager step.<br>\nThus time draws forward each and everything<br>\nLittle by little into the midst of men,<br>\nAnd reason uplifts it to the shores of light.<br>\nFor one thing after other did men see<br>\nGrow clear by intellect, till with their arts<br>\nThey’ve now achieved the supreme pinnacle.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/vi/proem/\">BOOK VI - PROEM</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                              Afterwards,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhen huts they had procured and pelts and fire,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd when the woman, joined unto the man,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWithdrew with him into one dwelling place,"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"hr","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Were known; and when they saw an offspring born"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom out themselves, then first the human race"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBegan to soften.
