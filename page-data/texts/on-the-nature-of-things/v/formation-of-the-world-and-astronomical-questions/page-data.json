For of a truth<br>\nNeither by counsel did the primal germs<br>\n‘Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,<br>\nEach in its proper place; nor did they make,<br>\nForsooth, a compact how each germ should move;<br>\nBut, lo, because primordials of things,<br>\nMany in many modes, astir by blows<br>\nFrom immemorial aeons, in motion too<br>\nBy their own weights, have evermore been wont<br>\nTo be so borne along and in all modes<br>\nTo meet together and to try all sorts<br>\nWhich, by combining one with other, they<br>\nAre powerful to create: because of this<br>\nIt comes to pass that those primordials,<br>\nDiffused far and wide through mighty aeons,<br>\nThe while they unions try, and motions too,<br>\nOf every kind, meet at the last amain,<br>\nAnd so become oft the commencements fit<br>\nOf mighty things—earth, sea, and sky, and race<br>\nOf living creatures.</p>\n<p>                   In that long-ago<br>\nThe wheel of the sun could nowhere be discerned<br>\nFlying far up with its abounding blaze,<br>\nNor constellations of the mighty world,<br>\nNor ocean, nor heaven, nor even earth nor air.<br>\nNor aught of things like unto things of ours<br>\nCould then be seen—but only some strange storm<br>\nAnd a prodigious hurly-burly mass<br>\nCompounded of all kinds of primal germs,<br>\nWhose battling discords in disorder kept<br>\nInterstices, and paths, coherencies,<br>\nAnd weights, and blows, encounterings, and motions,<br>\nBecause, by reason of their forms unlike<br>\nAnd varied shapes, they could not all thuswise<br>\nRemain conjoined nor harmoniously<br>\nHave interplay of movements. But from there<br>\nPortions began to fly asunder, and like<br>\nWith like to join, and to block out a world,<br>\nAnd to divide its members and dispose<br>\nIts mightier parts—that is, to set secure<br>\nThe lofty heavens from the lands, and cause<br>\nThe sea to spread with waters separate,<br>\nAnd fires of ether separate and pure<br>\nLikewise to congregate apart.</p>\n<p>                            For, lo,<br>\nFirst came together the earthy particles<br>\n(As being heavy and intertangled) there<br>\nIn the mid-region, and all began to take<br>\nThe lowest abodes; and ever the more they got<br>\nOne with another intertangled, the more<br>\nThey pressed from out their mass those particles<br>\nWhich were to form the sea, the stars, the sun,<br>\nAnd moon, and ramparts of the mighty world—<br>\nFor these consist of seeds more smooth and round<br>\nAnd of much smaller elements than earth.<br>\nAnd thus it was that ether, fraught with fire,<br>\nFirst broke away from out the earthen parts,<br>\nAthrough the innumerable pores of earth,<br>\nAnd raised itself aloft, and with itself<br>\nBore lightly off the many starry fires;<br>\nAnd not far otherwise we often see</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And the still lakes and the perennial streams<br>\nExhale a mist, and even as earth herself<br>\nIs seen at times to smoke, when first at dawn<br>\nThe light of the sun, the many-rayed, begins<br>\nTo redden into gold, over the grass<br>\nBegemmed with dew. When all of these are brought<br>\nTogether overhead, the clouds on high<br>\nWith now concreted body weave a cover<br>\nBeneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too,<br>\nLight and diffusive, with concreted body<br>\nOn all sides spread, on all sides bent itself<br>\nInto a dome, and, far and wide diffused<br>\nOn unto every region on all sides,<br>\nThus hedged all else within its greedy clasp.<br>\nHard upon ether came the origins<br>\nOf sun and moon, whose globes revolve in air<br>\nMidway between the earth and mightiest ether,—<br>\nFor neither took them, since they weighed too little<br>\nTo sink and settle, but too much to glide<br>\nAlong the upmost shores; and yet they are<br>\nIn such a wise midway between the twain<br>\nAs ever to whirl their living bodies round,<br>\nAnd ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole;<br>\nIn the same fashion as certain members may<br>\nIn us remain at rest, whilst others move.<br>\nWhen, then, these substances had been withdrawn,<br>\nAmain the earth, where now extend the vast<br>\nCerulean zones of all the level seas,<br>\nCaved in, and down along the hollows poured<br>\nThe whirlpools of her brine; and day by day<br>\nThe more the tides of ether and rays of sun<br>\nOn every side constrained into one mass<br>\nThe earth by lashing it again, again,<br>\nUpon its outer edges (so that then,<br>\nBeing thus beat upon, ‘twas all condensed<br>\nAbout its proper centre), ever the more<br>\nThe salty sweat, from out its body squeezed,<br>\nAugmented ocean and the fields of foam<br>\nBy seeping through its frame, and all the more<br>\nThose many particles of heat and air<br>\nEscaping, began to fly aloft, and form,<br>\nBy condensation there afar from earth,<br>\nThe high refulgent circuits of the heavens.<br>\nThe plains began to sink, and windy slopes<br>\nOf the high mountains to increase; for rocks<br>\nCould not subside, nor all the parts of ground<br>\nSettle alike to one same level there.</p>\n<p>Thus, then, the massy weight of earth stood firm<br>\nWith now concreted body, when (as ‘twere)<br>\nAll of the slime of the world, heavy and gross,<br>\nHad run together and settled at the bottom,<br>\nLike lees or bilge. Then ocean, then the air,<br>\nThen ether herself, the fraught-with-fire, were all<br>\nLeft with their liquid bodies pure and free,<br>\nAnd each more lighter than the next below;<br>\nAnd ether, most light and liquid of the three,<br>\nFloats on above the long aerial winds,<br>\nNor with the brawling of the winds of air<br>\nMingles its liquid body. It doth leave<br>\nAll there—those under-realms below her heights—<br>\nThere to be overset in whirlwinds wild,—<br>\nDoth leave all there to brawl in wayward gusts,<br>\nWhilst, gliding with a fixed impulse still,<br>\nItself it bears its fires along. For, lo,<br>\nThat ether can flow thus steadily on, on,<br>\nWith one unaltered urge, the Pontus proves—<br>\nThat sea which floweth forth with fixed tides,<br>\nKeeping one onward tenor as it glides.</p>\n<p>And that the earth may there abide at rest<br>\nIn the mid-region of the world, it needs<br>\nMust vanish bit by bit in weight and lessen,<br>\nAnd have another substance underneath,<br>\nConjoined to it from its earliest age<br>\nIn linked unison with the vasty world’s<br>\nRealms of the air in which it roots and lives.<br>\nOn this account, the earth is not a load,<br>\nNor presses down on winds of air beneath;<br>\nEven as unto a man his members be<br>\nWithout all weight—the head is not a load<br>\nUnto the neck; nor do we feel the whole<br>\nWeight of the body to centre in the feet.<br>\nBut whatso weights come on us from without,<br>\nWeights laid upon us, these harass and chafe,<br>\nThough often far lighter. For to such degree<br>\nIt matters always what the innate powers<br>\nOf any given thing may be. The earth<br>\nWas, then, no alien substance fetched amain,<br>\nAnd from no alien firmament cast down<br>\nOn alien air; but was conceived, like air,<br>\nIn the first origin of this the world,<br>\nAs a fixed portion of the same, as now<br>\nOur members are seen to be a part of us.</p>\n<p>Besides, the earth, when of a sudden shook<br>\nBy the big thunder, doth with her motion shake<br>\nAll that’s above her—which she ne’er could do<br>\nBy any means, were earth not bounden fast<br>\nUnto the great world’s realms of air and sky:<br>\nFor they cohere together with common roots,<br>\nConjoined both, even from their earliest age,<br>\nIn linked unison. Aye, seest thou not<br>\nThat this most subtle energy of soul<br>\nSupports our body, though so heavy a weight,—<br>\nBecause, indeed, ‘tis with it so conjoined<br>\nIn linked unison? What power, in sum,<br>\nCan raise with agile leap our body aloft,<br>\nSave energy of mind which steers the limbs?<br>\nNow seest thou not how powerful may be<br>\nA subtle nature, when conjoined it is<br>\nWith heavy body, as air is with the earth<br>\nConjoined, and energy of mind with us?</p>\n<p>Now let us sing what makes the stars to move.<br>\nIn first place, if the mighty sphere of heaven<br>\nRevolveth round, then needs we must aver<br>\nThat on the upper and the under pole<br>\nPresses a certain air, and from without<br>\nConfines them and encloseth at each end;<br>\nAnd that, moreover, another air above<br>\nStreams on athwart the top of the sphere and tends<br>\nIn same direction as are rolled along<br>\nThe glittering stars of the eternal world;<br>\nOr that another still streams on below<br>\nTo whirl the sphere from under up and on<br>\nIn opposite direction—as we see<br>\nThe rivers turn the wheels and water-scoops.<br>\nIt may be also that the heavens do all<br>\nRemain at rest, whilst yet are borne along<br>\nThe lucid constellations; either because<br>\nSwift tides of ether are by sky enclosed,<br>\nAnd whirl around, seeking a passage out,<br>\nAnd everywhere make roll the starry fires<br>\nThrough the Summanian regions of the sky;<br>\nOr else because some air, streaming along<br>\nFrom an eternal quarter off beyond,<br>\nWhileth the driven fires, or, then, because<br>\nThe fires themselves have power to creep along,<br>\nGoing wherever their food invites and calls,<br>\nAnd feeding their flaming bodies everywhere<br>\nThroughout the sky. Yet which of these is cause<br>\nIn this our world ‘tis hard to say for sure;<br>\nBut what can be throughout the universe,<br>\nIn divers worlds on divers plan create,<br>\nThis only do I show, and follow on<br>\nTo assign unto the motions of the stars<br>\nEven several causes which ‘tis possible<br>\nExist throughout the universal All;<br>\nOf which yet one must be the cause even here<br>\nWhich maketh motion for our constellations.<br>\nYet to decide which one of them it be<br>\nIs not the least the business of a man<br>\nAdvancing step by cautious step, as I.</p>\n<p>Nor can the sun’s wheel larger be by much<br>\nNor its own blaze much less than either seems<br>\nUnto our senses. For from whatso spaces<br>\nFires have the power on us to cast their beams<br>\nAnd blow their scorching exhalations forth<br>\nAgainst our members, those same distances<br>\nTake nothing by those intervals away<br>\nFrom bulk of flames; and to the sight the fire<br>\nIs nothing shrunken. Therefore, since the heat<br>\nAnd the outpoured light of skiey sun<br>\nArrive our senses and caress our limbs,<br>\nForm too and bigness of the sun must look<br>\nEven here from earth just as they really be,<br>\nSo that thou canst scarce nothing take or add.<br>\nAnd whether the journeying moon illuminate<br>\nThe regions round with bastard beams, or throw<br>\nFrom off her proper body her own light,—<br>\nWhichever it be, she journeys with a form<br>\nNaught larger than the form doth seem to be<br>\nWhich we with eyes of ours perceive. For all<br>\nThe far removed objects of our gaze<br>\nSeem through much air confused in their look<br>\nEre minished in their bigness. Wherefore, moon,<br>\nSince she presents bright look and clear-cut form,<br>\nMay there on high by us on earth be seen<br>\nJust as she is with extreme bounds defined,<br>\nAnd just of the size. And lastly, whatso fires<br>\nOf ether thou from earth beholdest, these<br>\nThou mayst consider as possibly of size<br>\nThe least bit less, or larger by a hair<br>\nThan they appear—since whatso fires we view<br>\nHere in the lands of earth are seen to change<br>\nFrom time to time their size to less or more<br>\nOnly the least, when more or less away,<br>\nSo long as still they bicker clear, and still<br>\nTheir glow’s perceived.</p>\n<p>                    Nor need there be for men<br>\nAstonishment that yonder sun so small<br>\nCan yet send forth so great a light as fills<br>\nOceans and all the lands and sky aflood,<br>\nAnd with its fiery exhalations steeps<br>\nThe world at large. For it may be, indeed,<br>\nThat one vast-flowing well-spring of the whole<br>\nWide world from here hath opened and out-gushed,<br>\nAnd shot its light abroad; because thuswise<br>\nThe elements of fiery exhalations<br>\nFrom all the world around together come,<br>\nAnd thuswise flow into a bulk so big<br>\nThat from one single fountain-head may stream<br>\nThis heat and light. And seest thou not, indeed,<br>\nHow widely one small water-spring may wet<br>\nThe meadow-lands at times and flood the fields?<br>\n‘Tis even possible, besides, that heat<br>\nFrom forth the sun’s own fire, albeit that fire<br>\nBe not a great, may permeate the air<br>\nWith the fierce hot—if but, perchance, the air<br>\nBe of condition and so tempered then<br>\nAs to be kindled, even when beat upon<br>\nOnly by little particles of heat—<br>\nJust as we sometimes see the standing grain<br>\nOr stubble straw in conflagration all<br>\nFrom one lone spark. And possibly the sun,<br>\nAgleam on high with rosy lampion,<br>\nPossesses about him with invisible heats<br>\nA plenteous fire, by no effulgence marked,<br>\nSo that he maketh, he, the Fraught-with-fire,<br>\nIncrease to such degree the force of rays.</p>\n<p>Nor is there one sure cause revealed to men<br>\nHow the sun journeys from his summer haunts<br>\nOn to the mid-most winter turning-points<br>\nIn Capricorn, the thence reverting veers<br>\nBack to solstitial goals of Cancer; nor<br>\nHow ‘tis the moon is seen each month to cross<br>\nThat very distance which in traversing<br>\nThe sun consumes the measure of a year.<br>\nI say, no one clear reason hath been given<br>\nFor these affairs. Yet chief in likelihood<br>\nSeemeth the doctrine which the holy thought<br>\nOf great Democritus lays down: that ever<br>\nThe nearer the constellations be to earth<br>\nThe less can they by whirling of the sky<br>\nBe borne along, because those skiey powers<br>\nOf speed aloft do vanish and decrease<br>\nIn under-regions, and the sun is thus<br>\nLeft by degrees behind amongst those signs<br>\nThat follow after, since the sun he lies<br>\nFar down below the starry signs that blaze;<br>\nAnd the moon lags even tardier than the sun:<br>\nIn just so far as is her course removed<br>\nFrom upper heaven and nigh unto the lands,<br>\nIn just so far she fails to keep the pace<br>\nWith starry signs above; for just so far<br>\nAs feebler is the whirl that bears her on,<br>\n(Being, indeed, still lower than the sun),<br>\nIn just so far do all the starry signs,<br>\nCircling around, o’ertake her and o’erpass.<br>\nTherefore it happens that the moon appears<br>\nMore swiftly to return to any sign<br>\nAlong the Zodiac, than doth the sun,<br>\nBecause those signs do visit her again<br>\nMore swiftly than they visit the great sun.<br>\nIt can be also that two streams of air<br>\nAlternately at fixed periods<br>\nBlow out from transverse regions of the world,<br>\nOf which the one may thrust the sun away<br>\nFrom summer-signs to mid-most winter goals<br>\nAnd rigors of the cold, and the other then<br>\nMay cast him back from icy shades of chill<br>\nEven to the heat-fraught regions and the signs<br>\nThat blaze along the Zodiac. So, too,<br>\nWe must suppose the moon and all the stars,<br>\nWhich through the mighty and sidereal years<br>\nRoll round in mighty orbits, may be sped<br>\nBy streams of air from regions alternate.<br>\nSeest thou not also how the clouds be sped<br>\nBy contrary winds to regions contrary,<br>\nThe lower clouds diversely from the upper?<br>\nThen, why may yonder stars in ether there<br>\nAlong their mighty orbits not be borne<br>\nBy currents opposite the one to other?</p>\n<p>But night o’erwhelms the lands with vasty murk<br>\nEither when sun, after his diurnal course,<br>\nHath walked the ultimate regions of the sky<br>\nAnd wearily hath panted forth his fires,<br>\nShivered by their long journeying and wasted<br>\nBy traversing the multitudinous air,<br>\nOr else because the self-same force that drave<br>\nHis orb along above the lands compels<br>\nHim then to turn his course beneath the lands.<br>\nMatuta also at a fixed hour<br>\nSpreadeth the roseate morning out along<br>\nThe coasts of heaven and deploys the light,<br>\nEither because the self-same sun, returning<br>\nUnder the lands, aspires to seize the sky,<br>\nStriving to set it blazing with his rays<br>\nEre he himself appear, or else because<br>\nFires then will congregate and many seeds<br>\nOf heat are wont, even at a fixed time,<br>\nTo stream together—gendering evermore<br>\nNew suns and light. Just so the story goes<br>\nThat from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen<br>\nDispersed fires upon the break of day<br>\nWhich thence combine, as ‘twere, into one ball<br>\nAnd form an orb. Nor yet in these affairs<br>\nIs aught for wonder that these seeds of fire<br>\nCan thus together stream at time so fixed<br>\nAnd shape anew the splendour of the sun.<br>\nFor many facts we see which come to pass<br>\nAt fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs<br>\nAt fixed time, and at a fixed time<br>\nThey cast their flowers; and Eld commands the teeth,<br>\nAt time as surely fixed, to drop away,<br>\nAnd Youth commands the growing boy to bloom<br>\nWith the soft down and let from both his cheeks<br>\nThe soft beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts,<br>\nSnow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons of the year<br>\nNowise unfixed, all do come to pass.<br>\nFor where, even from their old primordial start<br>\nCauses have ever worked in such a way,<br>\nAnd where, even from the world’s first origin,<br>\nThuswise have things befallen, so even now<br>\nAfter a fixed order they come round<br>\nIn sequence also.</p>\n<p>                 Likewise, days may wax<br>\nWhilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be<br>\nWhilst nights do take their augmentations,<br>\nEither because the self-same sun, coursing<br>\nUnder the lands and over in two arcs,<br>\nA longer and a briefer, doth dispart<br>\nThe coasts of ether and divides in twain<br>\nHis orbit all unequally, and adds,<br>\nAs round he’s borne, unto the one half there<br>\nAs much as from the other half he’s ta’en,<br>\nUntil he then arrives that sign of heaven<br>\nWhere the year’s node renders the shades of night<br>\nEqual unto the periods of light.<br>\nFor when the sun is midway on his course<br>\nBetween the blasts of northwind and of south,<br>\nHeaven keeps his two goals parted equally,<br>\nBy virtue of the fixed position old<br>\nOf the whole starry Zodiac, through which<br>\nThat sun, in winding onward, takes a year,<br>\nIllumining the sky and all the lands<br>\nWith oblique light—as men declare to us<br>\nWho by their diagrams have charted well<br>\nThose regions of the sky which be adorned<br>\nWith the arranged signs of Zodiac.<br>\nOr else, because in certain parts the air<br>\nUnder the lands is denser, the tremulous<br>\nBright beams of fire do waver tardily,<br>\nNor easily can penetrate that air<br>\nNor yet emerge unto their rising-place:<br>\nFor this it is that nights in winter time<br>\nDo linger long, ere comes the many-rayed<br>\nRound Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,<br>\nIn alternating seasons of the year<br>\nFires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont<br>\nTo stream together,—the fires which make the sun<br>\nTo rise in some one spot—therefore it is<br>\nThat those men seem to speak the truth [who hold<br>\nA new sun is with each new daybreak born].</p>\n<p>The moon she possibly doth shine because<br>\nStrook by the rays of sun, and day by day<br>\nMay turn unto our gaze her light, the more<br>\nShe doth recede from orb of sun, until,<br>\nFacing him opposite across the world,<br>\nShe hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad,<br>\nAnd, at her rising as she soars above,<br>\nHath there observed his setting; thence likewise<br>\nShe needs must hide, as ‘twere, her light behind<br>\nBy slow degrees, the nearer now she glides,<br>\nAlong the circle of the Zodiac,<br>\nFrom her far place toward fires of yonder sun,—<br>\nAs those men hold who feign the moon to be<br>\nJust like a ball and to pursue a course<br>\nBetwixt the sun and earth. There is, again,<br>\nSome reason to suppose that moon may roll<br>\nWith light her very own, and thus display<br>\nThe varied shapes of her resplendence there.<br>\nFor near her is, percase, another body,<br>\nInvisible, because devoid of light,<br>\nBorne on and gliding all along with her,<br>\nWhich in three modes may block and blot her disk.<br>\nAgain, she may revolve upon herself,<br>\nLike to a ball’s sphere—if perchance that be—<br>\nOne half of her dyed o’er with glowing light,<br>\nAnd by the revolution of that sphere<br>\nShe may beget for us her varying shapes,<br>\nUntil she turns that fiery part of her<br>\nFull to the sight and open eyes of men;<br>\nThence by slow stages round and back she whirls,<br>\nWithdrawing thus the luminiferous part<br>\nOf her sphered mass and ball, as, verily,<br>\nThe Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees,<br>\nRefuting the art of Greek astrologers,<br>\nLabours, in opposition, to prove sure—<br>\nAs if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights,<br>\nMight not alike be true,—or aught there were<br>\nWherefore thou mightest risk embracing one<br>\nMore than the other notion. Then, again,<br>\nWhy a new moon might not forevermore<br>\nCreated be with fixed successions there<br>\nOf shapes and with configurations fixed,<br>\nAnd why each day that bright created moon<br>\nMight not miscarry and another be,<br>\nIn its stead and place, engendered anew,<br>\n‘Tis hard to show by reason, or by words<br>\nTo prove absurd—since, lo, so many things<br>\nCan be create with fixed successions:<br>\nSpring-time and Venus come, and Venus’ boy,<br>\nThe winged harbinger, steps on before,<br>\nAnd hard on Zephyr’s foot-prints Mother Flora,<br>\nSprinkling the ways before them, filleth all<br>\nWith colours and with odours excellent;<br>\nWhereafter follows arid Heat, and he<br>\nCompanioned is by Ceres, dusty one,<br>\nAnd by the Etesian Breezes of the north;<br>\nThen cometh Autumn on, and with him steps<br>\nLord Bacchus, and then other Seasons too<br>\nAnd other Winds do follow—the high roar<br>\nOf great Volturnus, and the Southwind strong<br>\nWith thunder-bolts. At last earth’s Shortest-Day<br>\nBears on to men the snows and brings again<br>\nThe numbing cold. And Winter follows her,<br>\nHis teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, ‘tis<br>\nThe less a marvel, if at fixed time<br>\nA moon is thus begotten and again<br>\nAt fixed time destroyed, since things so many<br>\nCan come to being thus at fixed time.<br>\nLikewise, the sun’s eclipses and the moon’s<br>\nFar occultations rightly thou mayst deem</p>\n<p>As due to several causes.
