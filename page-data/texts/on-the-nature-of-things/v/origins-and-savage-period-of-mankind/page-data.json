What sun and rains<br>\nTo them had given, what earth of own accord<br>\nCreated then, was boon enough to glad<br>\nTheir simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks<br>\nWould they refresh their bodies for the nonce;<br>\nAnd the wild berries of the arbute-tree,<br>\nWhich now thou seest to ripen purple-red<br>\nIn winter time, the old telluric soil<br>\nWould bear then more abundant and more big.<br>\nAnd many coarse foods, too, in long ago<br>\nThe blooming freshness of the rank young world<br>\nProduced, enough for those poor wretches there.<br>\nAnd rivers and springs would summon them of old<br>\nTo slake the thirst, as now from the great hills<br>\nThe water’s down-rush calls aloud and far<br>\nThe thirsty generations of the wild.<br>\nSo, too, they sought the grottos of the Nymphs—<br>\nThe woodland haunts discovered as they ranged—<br>\nFrom forth of which they knew that gliding rills<br>\nWith gush and splash abounding laved the rocks,<br>\nThe dripping rocks, and trickled from above<br>\nOver the verdant moss; and here and there<br>\nWelled up and burst across the open flats.<br>\nAs yet they knew not to enkindle fire<br>\nAgainst the cold, nor hairy pelts to use<br>\nAnd clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;<br>\nBut huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods,<br>\nAnd ‘mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs,<br>\nWhen driven to flee the lashings of the winds<br>\nAnd the big rains. Nor could they then regard<br>\nThe general good, nor did they know to use<br>\nIn common any customs, any laws:<br>\nWhatever of booty fortune unto each<br>\nHad proffered, each alone would bear away,<br>\nBy instinct trained for self to thrive and live.<br>\nAnd Venus in the forests then would link<br>\nThe lovers’ bodies; for the woman yielded<br>\nEither from mutual flame, or from the man’s<br>\nImpetuous fury and insatiate lust,<br>\nOr from a bribe—as acorn-nuts, choice pears,<br>\nOr the wild berries of the arbute-tree.<br>\nAnd trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs,<br>\nThey’d chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts;<br>\nAnd many they’d conquer, but some few they fled,<br>\nA-skulk into their hiding-places…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>With the flung stones and with the ponderous heft<br>\nOf gnarled branch. And by the time of night<br>\nO’ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,<br>\nTheir wildman’s limbs naked upon the earth,<br>\nRolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.<br>\nNor would they call with lamentations loud<br>\nAround the fields for daylight and the sun,<br>\nQuaking and wand’ring in shadows of the night;<br>\nBut, silent and buried in a sleep, they’d wait<br>\nUntil the sun with rosy flambeau brought<br>\nThe glory to the sky. From childhood wont<br>\nEver to see the dark and day begot<br>\nIn times alternate, never might they be<br>\nWildered by wild misgiving, lest a night<br>\nEternal should possess the lands, with light<br>\nOf sun withdrawn forever. But their care<br>\nWas rather that the clans of savage beasts<br>\nWould often make their sleep-time horrible<br>\nFor those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven,<br>\nThey’d flee their rocky shelters at approach<br>\nOf boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,<br>\nAnd in the midnight yield with terror up<br>\nTo those fierce guests their beds of out-spread leaves.</p>\n<p>And yet in those days not much more than now<br>\nWould generations of mortality<br>\nLeave the sweet light of fading life behind.<br>\nIndeed, in those days here and there a man,<br>\nMore oftener snatched upon, and gulped by fangs,<br>\nAfforded the beasts a food that roared alive,<br>\nEchoing through groves and hills and forest-trees,<br>\nEven as he viewed his living flesh entombed<br>\nWithin a living grave; whilst those whom flight<br>\nHad saved, with bone and body bitten, shrieked,<br>\nPressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores,<br>\nWith horrible voices for eternal death—<br>\nUntil, forlorn of help, and witless what<br>\nMight medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs<br>\nTook them from life. But not in those far times<br>\nWould one lone day give over unto doom<br>\nA soldiery in thousands marching on<br>\nBeneath the battle-banners, nor would then<br>\nThe ramping breakers of the main seas dash<br>\nWhole argosies and crews upon the rocks.<br>\nBut ocean uprisen would often rave in vain,<br>\nWithout all end or outcome, and give up<br>\nIts empty menacings as lightly too;<br>\nNor soft seductions of a serene sea<br>\nCould lure by laughing billows any man<br>\nOut to disaster: for the science bold<br>\nOf ship-sailing lay dark in those far times.<br>\nAgain, ‘twas then that lack of food gave o’er<br>\nMen’s fainting limbs to dissolution: now<br>\n‘Tis plenty overwhelms. Unwary, they<br>\nOft for themselves themselves would then outpour<br>\nThe poison; now, with nicer art, themselves<br>\nThey give the drafts to others.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/v/beginnings-of-civilization/\">BOOK V - BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                         But mortal man"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWas then far hardier in the old champaign,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAs well he should be, since a hardier earth"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nHad him begotten; builded too was he"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOf bigger and more solid bones within,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd knit with stalwart sinews through the flesh,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNor easily seized by either heat or cold,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOr alien food or any ail or irk."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd whilst so many lustrums of the sun"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nRolled on across the sky, men led a life"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAfter the roving habit of wild beasts."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNot then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd none knew then to work the fields with iron,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOr plant young shoots in holes of delved loam,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOr lop with hooked knives from off high trees"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe boughs of yester-year.
