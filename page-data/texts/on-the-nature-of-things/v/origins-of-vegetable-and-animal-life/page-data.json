For from sky<br>\nThese breathing-creatures never can have dropped,<br>\nNor the land-dwellers ever have come up<br>\nOut of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,<br>\nHow merited is that adopted name<br>\nOf earth—“The Mother!”—since from out the earth<br>\nAre all begotten. And even now arise<br>\nFrom out the loams how many living things—<br>\nConcreted by the rains and heat of the sun.<br>\nWherefore ‘tis less a marvel, if they sprang<br>\nIn Long Ago more many, and more big,<br>\nMatured of those days in the fresh young years<br>\nOf earth and ether. First of all, the race<br>\nOf the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,<br>\nHatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;<br>\nAs now-a-days in summer tree-crickets<br>\nDo leave their shiny husks of own accord,<br>\nSeeking their food and living. Then it was<br>\nThis earth of thine first gave unto the day<br>\nThe mortal generations; for prevailed<br>\nAmong the fields abounding hot and wet.<br>\nAnd hence, where any fitting spot was given,<br>\nThere ‘gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots<br>\nAffixed to earth. And when in ripened time<br>\nThe age of the young within (that sought the air<br>\nAnd fled earth’s damps) had burst these wombs, O then<br>\nWould Nature thither turn the pores of earth<br>\nAnd make her spurt from open veins a juice<br>\nLike unto milk; even as a woman now<br>\nIs filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,<br>\nBecause all that swift stream of aliment<br>\nIs thither turned unto the mother-breasts.<br>\nThere earth would furnish to the children food;<br>\nWarmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed<br>\nAbounding in soft down. Earth’s newness then<br>\nWould rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,<br>\nNor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers—<br>\nFor all things grow and gather strength through time<br>\nIn like proportions; and then earth was young.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, again, again, how merited<br>\nIs that adopted name of Earth—The Mother!—<br>\nSince she herself begat the human race,<br>\nAnd at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth<br>\nEach breast that ranges raving round about<br>\nUpon the mighty mountains and all birds<br>\nAerial with many a varied shape.<br>\nBut, lo, because her bearing years must end,<br>\nShe ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.<br>\nFor lapsing aeons change the nature of<br>\nThe whole wide world, and all things needs must take<br>\nOne status after other, nor aught persists<br>\nForever like itself. All things depart;<br>\nNature she changeth all, compelleth all<br>\nTo transformation. Lo, this moulders down,<br>\nA-slack with weary eld, and that, again,<br>\nProspers in glory, issuing from contempt.<br>\nIn suchwise, then, the lapsing aeons change<br>\nThe nature of the whole wide world, and earth<br>\nTaketh one status after other. And what<br>\nShe bore of old, she now can bear no longer,<br>\nAnd what she never bore, she can to-day.</p>\n<p>In those days also the telluric world<br>\nStrove to beget the monsters that upsprung<br>\nWith their astounding visages and limbs—<br>\nThe Man-woman—a thing betwixt the twain,<br>\nYet neither, and from either sex remote—<br>\nSome gruesome Boggles orphaned of the feet,<br>\nSome widowed of the hands, dumb Horrors too<br>\nWithout a mouth, or blind Ones of no eye,<br>\nOr Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms<br>\nCleaving unto the body fore and aft,<br>\nThuswise, that never could they do or go,<br>\nNor shun disaster, nor take the good they would.<br>\nAnd other prodigies and monsters earth<br>\nWas then begetting of this sort—in vain,<br>\nSince Nature banned with horror their increase,<br>\nAnd powerless were they to reach unto<br>\nThe coveted flower of fair maturity,<br>\nOr to find aliment, or to intertwine<br>\nIn works of Venus. For we see there must<br>\nConcur in life conditions manifold,<br>\nIf life is ever by begetting life<br>\nTo forge the generations one by one:<br>\nFirst, foods must be; and, next, a path whereby<br>\nThe seeds of impregnation in the frame<br>\nMay ooze, released from the members all;<br>\nLast, the possession of those instruments<br>\nWhereby the male with female can unite,<br>\nThe one with other in mutual ravishments.</p>\n<p>And in the ages after monsters died,<br>\nPerforce there perished many a stock, unable<br>\nBy propagation to forge a progeny.<br>\nFor whatsoever creatures thou beholdest<br>\nBreathing the breath of life, the same have been<br>\nEven from their earliest age preserved alive<br>\nBy cunning, or by valour, or at least<br>\nBy speed of foot or wing. And many a stock<br>\nRemaineth yet, because of use to man,<br>\nAnd so committed to man’s guardianship.<br>\nValour hath saved alive fierce lion-breeds<br>\nAnd many another terrorizing race,<br>\nCunning the foxes, flight the antlered stags.<br>\nLight-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast,<br>\nHowever, and every kind begot from seed<br>\nOf beasts of draft, as, too, the woolly flocks<br>\nAnd horned cattle, all, my Memmius,<br>\nHave been committed to guardianship of men.<br>\nFor anxiously they fled the savage beasts,<br>\nAnd peace they sought and their abundant foods,<br>\nObtained with never labours of their own,<br>\nWhich we secure to them as fit rewards<br>\nFor their good service. But those beasts to whom<br>\nNature has granted naught of these same things—<br>\nBeasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive<br>\nAnd vain for any service unto us<br>\nIn thanks for which we should permit their kind<br>\nTo feed and be in our protection safe—<br>\nThose, of a truth, were wont to be exposed,<br>\nEnshackled in the gruesome bonds of doom,<br>\nAs prey and booty for the rest, until<br>\nNature reduced that stock to utter death.</p>\n<p>But Centaurs ne’er have been, nor can there be<br>\nCreatures of twofold stock and double frame,<br>\nCompact of members alien in kind,<br>\nYet formed with equal function, equal force<br>\nIn every bodily part—a fact thou mayst,<br>\nHowever dull thy wits, well learn from this:<br>\nThe horse, when his three years have rolled away,<br>\nFlowers in his prime of vigour; but the boy<br>\nNot so, for oft even then he gropes in sleep<br>\nAfter the milky nipples of the breasts,<br>\nAn infant still. And later, when at last<br>\nThe lusty powers of horses and stout limbs,<br>\nNow weak through lapsing life, do fail with age,<br>\nLo, only then doth youth with flowering years<br>\nBegin for boys, and clothe their ruddy cheeks<br>\nWith the soft down. So never deem, percase,<br>\nThat from a man and from the seed of horse,<br>\nThe beast of draft, can Centaurs be composed<br>\nOr e’er exist alive, nor Scyllas be—<br>\nThe half-fish bodies girdled with mad dogs—<br>\nNor others of this sort, in whom we mark<br>\nMembers discordant each with each; for ne’er<br>\nAt one same time they reach their flower of age<br>\nOr gain and lose full vigour of their frame,<br>\nAnd never burn with one same lust of love,<br>\nAnd never in their habits they agree,<br>\nNor find the same foods equally delightsome—<br>\nSooth, as one oft may see the bearded goats<br>\nBatten upon the hemlock which to man<br>\nIs violent poison. Once again, since flame<br>\nIs wont to scorch and burn the tawny bulks<br>\nOf the great lions as much as other kinds<br>\nOf flesh and blood existing in the lands,<br>\nHow could it be that she, Chimaera lone,<br>\nWith triple body—fore, a lion she;<br>\nAnd aft, a dragon; and betwixt, a goat—<br>\nMight at the mouth from out the body belch<br>\nInfuriate flame? Wherefore, the man who feigns<br>\nSuch beings could have been engendered<br>\nWhen earth was new and the young sky was fresh<br>\n(Basing his empty argument on new)<br>\nMay babble with like reason many whims<br>\nInto our ears: he’ll say, perhaps, that then<br>\nRivers of gold through every landscape flowed,<br>\nThat trees were wont with precious stones to flower,<br>\nOr that in those far aeons man was born<br>\nWith such gigantic length and lift of limbs<br>\nAs to be able, based upon his feet,<br>\nDeep oceans to bestride or with his hands<br>\nTo whirl the firmament around his head.<br>\nFor though in earth were many seeds of things<br>\nIn the old time when this telluric world<br>\nFirst poured the breeds of animals abroad,<br>\nStill that is nothing of a sign that then<br>\nSuch hybrid creatures could have been begot<br>\nAnd limbs of all beasts heterogeneous<br>\nHave been together knit; because, indeed,<br>\nThe divers kinds of grasses and the grains<br>\nAnd the delightsome trees—which even now<br>\nSpring up abounding from within the earth—<br>\nCan still ne’er be begotten with their stems<br>\nBegrafted into one; but each sole thing<br>\nProceeds according to its proper wont<br>\nAnd all conserve their own distinctions based<br>\nIn nature’s fixed decree.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/v/origins-and-savage-period-of-mankind/\">BOOK V - ORIGINS AND SAVAGE PERIOD OF MANKIND</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And now to what remains!—Since I’ve resolved"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBy what arrangements all things come to pass"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThrough the blue regions of the mighty world,—"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nHow we can know what energy and cause"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nStarted the various courses of the sun"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd the moon’s goings, and by what far means"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThey can succumb, the while with thwarted light,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhen, as it were, they blink, and then again"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith open eye survey all regions wide,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nResplendent with white radiance—I do now"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nReturn unto the world’s primeval age"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd tell what first the soft young fields of earth"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith earliest parturition had decreed"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTo raise in air unto the shores of light"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd to entrust unto the wayward winds."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn the beginning, earth gave forth, around"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe hills and over all the length of plains,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe race of grasses and the shining green;"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe flowery meadows sparkled all aglow"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith greening colour, and thereafter, lo,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nUnto the divers kinds of trees was given"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAn emulous impulse mightily to shoot,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith a free rein, aloft into the air."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAs feathers and hairs and bristles are begot"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe first on members of the four-foot breeds"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThus then the new Earth first of all put forth"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nGrasses and shrubs, and afterward begat"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe mortal generations, there upsprung—"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nInnumerable in modes innumerable—"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAfter diverging fashions.
