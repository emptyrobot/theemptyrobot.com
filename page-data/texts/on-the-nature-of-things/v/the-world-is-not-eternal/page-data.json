And therefore when I see<br>\nThe mightiest members and the parts of this<br>\nOur world consumed and begot again,<br>\n‘Tis mine to know that also sky above<br>\nAnd earth beneath began of old in time<br>\nAnd shall in time go under to disaster.</p>\n<p>And lest in these affairs thou deemest me<br>\nTo have seized upon this point by sleight to serve<br>\nMy own caprice—because I have assumed<br>\nThat earth and fire are mortal things indeed,<br>\nAnd have not doubted water and the air<br>\nBoth perish too and have affirmed the same<br>\nTo be again begotten and wax big—<br>\nMark well the argument: in first place, lo,<br>\nSome certain parts of earth, grievously parched<br>\nBy unremitting suns, and trampled on<br>\nBy a vast throng of feet, exhale abroad<br>\nA powdery haze and flying clouds of dust,<br>\nWhich the stout winds disperse in the whole air.<br>\nA part, moreover, of her sod and soil<br>\nIs summoned to inundation by the rains;<br>\nAnd rivers graze and gouge the banks away.<br>\nBesides, whatever takes a part its own<br>\nIn fostering and increasing [aught]…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Is rendered back; and since, beyond a doubt,<br>\nEarth, the all-mother, is beheld to be<br>\nLikewise the common sepulchre of things,<br>\nTherefore thou seest her minished of her plenty,<br>\nAnd then again augmented with new growth.</p>\n<p>And for the rest, that sea, and streams, and springs<br>\nForever with new waters overflow,<br>\nAnd that perennially the fluids well,<br>\nNeedeth no words—the mighty flux itself<br>\nOf multitudinous waters round about<br>\nDeclareth this. But whatso water first<br>\nStreams up is ever straightway carried off,<br>\nAnd thus it comes to pass that all in all<br>\nThere is no overflow; in part because<br>\nThe burly winds (that over-sweep amain)<br>\nAnd skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)<br>\nDo minish the level seas; in part because<br>\nThe water is diffused underground<br>\nThrough all the lands. The brine is filtered off,<br>\nAnd then the liquid stuff seeps back again<br>\nAnd all regathers at the river-heads,<br>\nWhence in fresh-water currents on it flows<br>\nOver the lands, adown the channels which<br>\nWere cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along<br>\nThe liquid-footed floods.</p>\n<p>                         Now, then, of air<br>\nI’ll speak, which hour by hour in all its body<br>\nIs changed innumerably. For whatso’er<br>\nStreams up in dust or vapour off of things,<br>\nThe same is all and always borne along<br>\nInto the mighty ocean of the air;<br>\nAnd did not air in turn restore to things<br>\nBodies, and thus recruit them as they stream,<br>\nAll things by this time had resolved been<br>\nAnd changed into air. Therefore it never<br>\nCeases to be engendered off of things<br>\nAnd to return to things, since verily<br>\nIn constant flux do all things stream.</p>\n<p>                             Likewise,<br>\nThe abounding well-spring of the liquid light,<br>\nThe ethereal sun, doth flood the heaven o’er<br>\nWith constant flux of radiance ever new,<br>\nAnd with fresh light supplies the place of light,<br>\nUpon the instant. For whatever effulgence<br>\nHath first streamed off, no matter where it falls,<br>\nIs lost unto the sun. And this ‘tis thine<br>\nTo know from these examples: soon as clouds<br>\nHave first begun to under-pass the sun,<br>\nAnd, as it were, to rend the rays of light<br>\nIn twain, at once the lower part of them<br>\nIs lost entire, and earth is overcast<br>\nWhere’er the thunderheads are rolled along—<br>\nSo know thou mayst that things forever need<br>\nA fresh replenishment of gleam and glow,<br>\nAnd each effulgence, foremost flashed forth,<br>\nPerisheth one by one. Nor otherwise<br>\nCan things be seen in sunlight, lest alway<br>\nThe fountain-head of light supply new light.<br>\nIndeed your earthly beacons of the night,<br>\nThe hanging lampions and the torches, bright<br>\nWith darting gleams and dense with livid soot,<br>\nDo hurry in like manner to supply<br>\nWith ministering heat new light amain;<br>\nAre all alive to quiver with their fires,—<br>\nAre so alive, that thus the light ne’er leaves<br>\nThe spots it shines on, as if rent in twain:<br>\nSo speedily is its destruction veiled<br>\nBy the swift birth of flame from all the fires.<br>\nThus, then, we must suppose that sun and moon<br>\nAnd stars dart forth their light from under-births<br>\nEver and ever new, and whatso flames<br>\nFirst rise do perish always one by one—<br>\nLest, haply, thou shouldst think they each endure<br>\nInviolable.</p>\n<p>          Again, perceivest not<br>\nHow stones are also conquered by Time?—<br>\nNot how the lofty towers ruin down,<br>\nAnd boulders crumble?—Not how shrines of gods<br>\nAnd idols crack outworn?—Nor how indeed<br>\nThe holy Influence hath yet no power<br>\nThere to postpone the Terminals of Fate,<br>\nOr headway make ‘gainst Nature’s fixed decrees?<br>\nAgain, behold we not the monuments<br>\nOf heroes, now in ruins, asking us,<br>\nIn their turn likewise, if we don’t believe<br>\nThey also age with eld? Behold we not<br>\nThe rended basalt ruining amain<br>\nDown from the lofty mountains, powerless<br>\nTo dure and dree the mighty forces there<br>\nOf finite time?—for they would never fall<br>\nRended asudden, if from infinite Past<br>\nThey had prevailed against all engin’ries<br>\nOf the assaulting aeons, with no crash.</p>\n<p>Again, now look at This, which round, above,<br>\nContains the whole earth in its one embrace:<br>\nIf from itself it procreates all things—<br>\nAs some men tell—and takes them to itself<br>\nWhen once destroyed, entirely must it be<br>\nOf mortal birth and body; for whate’er<br>\nFrom out itself giveth to other things<br>\nIncrease and food, the same perforce must be<br>\nMinished, and then recruited when it takes<br>\nThings back into itself.</p>\n<p>                      Besides all this,<br>\nIf there had been no origin-in-birth<br>\nOf lands and sky, and they had ever been<br>\nThe everlasting, why, ere Theban war<br>\nAnd obsequies of Troy, have other bards<br>\nNot also chanted other high affairs?<br>\nWhither have sunk so oft so many deeds<br>\nOf heroes? Why do those deeds live no more,<br>\nIngrafted in eternal monuments<br>\nOf glory? Verily, I guess, because<br>\nThe Sum is new, and of a recent date<br>\nThe nature of our universe, and had<br>\nNot long ago its own exordium.<br>\nWherefore, even now some arts are being still<br>\nRefined, still increased: now unto ships<br>\nIs being added many a new device;<br>\nAnd but the other day musician-folk<br>\nGave birth to melic sounds of organing;<br>\nAnd, then, this nature, this account of things<br>\nHath been discovered latterly, and I<br>\nMyself have been discovered only now,<br>\nAs first among the first, able to turn<br>\nThe same into ancestral Roman speech.<br>\nYet if, percase, thou deemest that ere this<br>\nExisted all things even the same, but that<br>\nPerished the cycles of the human race<br>\nIn fiery exhalations, or cities fell<br>\nBy some tremendous quaking of the world,<br>\nOr rivers in fury, after constant rains,<br>\nHad plunged forth across the lands of earth<br>\nAnd whelmed the towns—then, all the more must thou<br>\nConfess, defeated by the argument,<br>\nThat there shall be annihilation too<br>\nOf lands and sky. For at a time when things<br>\nWere being taxed by maladies so great,<br>\nAnd so great perils, if some cause more fell<br>\nHad then assailed them, far and wide they would<br>\nHave gone to disaster and supreme collapse.<br>\nAnd by no other reasoning are we<br>\nSeen to be mortal, save that all of us<br>\nSicken in turn with those same maladies<br>\nWith which have sickened in the past those men<br>\nWhom nature hath removed from life.</p>\n<p>gain,\nWhatever abides eternal must indeed<br>\nEither repel all strokes, because ‘tis made<br>\nOf solid body, and permit no entrance<br>\nOf aught with power to sunder from within<br>\nThe parts compact—as are those seeds of stuff<br>\nWhose nature we’ve exhibited before;<br>\nOr else be able to endure through time<br>\nFor this: because they are from blows exempt,<br>\nAs is the void, the which abides untouched,<br>\nUnsmit by any stroke; or else because<br>\nThere is no room around, whereto things can,<br>\nAs ‘twere, depart in dissolution all,—<br>\nEven as the sum of sums eternal is,<br>\nWithout or place beyond whereto things may<br>\nAsunder fly, or bodies which can smite,<br>\nAnd thus dissolve them by the blows of might.<br>\nBut not of solid body, as I’ve shown,<br>\nExists the nature of the world, because<br>\nIn things is intermingled there a void;<br>\nNor is the world yet as the void, nor are,<br>\nMoreover, bodies lacking which, percase,<br>\nRising from out the infinite, can fell<br>\nWith fury-whirlwinds all this sum of things,<br>\nOr bring upon them other cataclysm<br>\nOf peril strange; and yonder, too, abides<br>\nThe infinite space and the profound abyss—<br>\nWhereinto, lo, the ramparts of the world<br>\nCan yet be shivered. Or some other power<br>\nCan pound upon them till they perish all.<br>\nThus is the door of doom, O nowise barred<br>\nAgainst the sky, against the sun and earth<br>\nAnd deep-sea waters, but wide open stands<br>\nAnd gloats upon them, monstrous and agape.<br>\nWherefore, again, ‘tis needful to confess<br>\nThat these same things are born in time; for things<br>\nWhich are of mortal body could indeed<br>\nNever from infinite past until to-day<br>\nHave spurned the multitudinous assaults<br>\nOf the immeasurable aeons old.</p>\n<p>Again, since battle so fiercely one with other<br>\nThe four most mighty members the world,<br>\nAroused in an all unholy war,<br>\nSeest not that there may be for them an end<br>\nOf the long strife?—Or when the skiey sun<br>\nAnd all the heat have won dominion o’er<br>\nThe sucked-up waters all?—And this they try<br>\nStill to accomplish, though as yet they fail,—<br>\nFor so aboundingly the streams supply<br>\nNew store of waters that ‘tis rather they<br>\nWho menace the world with inundations vast<br>\nFrom forth the unplumbed chasms of the sea.<br>\nBut vain—since winds (that over-sweep amain)<br>\nAnd skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)<br>\nDo minish the level seas and trust their power<br>\nTo dry up all, before the waters can<br>\nArrive at the end of their endeavouring.<br>\nBreathing such vasty warfare, they contend<br>\nIn balanced strife the one with other still<br>\nConcerning mighty issues,—though indeed<br>\nThe fire was once the more victorious,<br>\nAnd once—as goes the tale—the water won<br>\nA kingdom in the fields. For fire o’ermastered<br>\nAnd licked up many things and burnt away,<br>\nWhat time the impetuous horses of the Sun<br>\nSnatched Phaethon headlong from his skiey road<br>\nDown the whole ether and over all the lands.<br>\nBut the omnipotent Father in keen wrath<br>\nThen with the sudden smite of thunderbolt<br>\nDid hurl the mighty-minded hero off<br>\nThose horses to the earth. And Sol, his sire,<br>\nMeeting him as he fell, caught up in hand<br>\nThe ever-blazing lampion of the world,<br>\nAnd drave together the pell-mell horses there<br>\nAnd yoked them all a-tremble, and amain,<br>\nSteering them over along their own old road,<br>\nRestored the cosmos,—as forsooth we hear<br>\nFrom songs of ancient poets of the Greeks—<br>\nA tale too far away from truth, meseems.<br>\nFor fire can win when from the infinite<br>\nHas risen a larger throng of particles<br>\nOf fiery stuff; and then its powers succumb,<br>\nSomehow subdued again, or else at last<br>\nIt shrivels in torrid atmospheres the world.<br>\nAnd whilom water too began to win—<br>\nAs goes the story—when it overwhelmed<br>\nThe lives of men with billows; and thereafter,<br>\nWhen all that force of water-stuff which forth<br>\nFrom out the infinite had risen up<br>\nDid now retire, as somehow turned aside,<br>\nThe rain-storms stopped, and streams their fury checked.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/v/formation-of-the-world-and-astronomical-questions/\">BOOK V - FORMATION OF THE WORLD AND ASTRONOMICAL QUESTIONS</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                         And first,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSince body of earth and water, air’s light breath,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd fiery exhalations (of which four"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis sum of things is seen to be compact)"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSo all have birth and perishable frame,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThus the whole nature of the world itself"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMust be conceived as perishable too."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFor, verily, those things of which we see"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe parts and members to have birth in time"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd perishable shapes, those same we mark"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTo be invariably born in time"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd born to die.
