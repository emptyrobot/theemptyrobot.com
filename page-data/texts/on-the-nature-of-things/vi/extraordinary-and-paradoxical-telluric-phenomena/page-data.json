Besides,<br>\nSun with his heat draws off a mighty part:<br>\nYea, we behold that sun with burning beams<br>\nTo dry our garments dripping all with wet;<br>\nAnd many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,<br>\nDo we behold. Therefore, however slight<br>\nThe portion of wet that sun on any spot<br>\nCulls from the level main, he still will take<br>\nFrom off the waves in such a wide expanse<br>\nAbundantly. Then, further, also winds,<br>\nSweeping the level waters, can bear off<br>\nA mighty part of wet, since we behold<br>\nOft in a single night the highways dried<br>\nBy winds, and soft mud crusted o’er at dawn.<br>\nAgain, I’ve taught thee that the clouds bear off<br>\nMuch moisture too, up-taken from the reaches<br>\nOf the mighty main, and sprinkle it about<br>\nO’er all the zones, when rain is on the lands<br>\nAnd winds convey the aery racks of vapour.<br>\nLastly, since earth is porous through her frame,<br>\nAnd neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,<br>\nThe water’s wet must seep into the lands<br>\nFrom briny ocean, as from lands it comes<br>\nInto the seas. For brine is filtered off,<br>\nAnd then the liquid stuff seeps back again<br>\nAnd all re-poureth at the river-heads,<br>\nWhence in fresh-water currents it returns<br>\nOver the lands, adown the channels which<br>\nWere cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along<br>\nThe liquid-footed floods.</p>\n<p>                         And now the cause<br>\nWhereby athrough the throat of Aetna’s Mount<br>\nSuch vast tornado-fires out-breathe at times,<br>\nI will unfold: for with no middling might<br>\nOf devastation the flamy tempest rose<br>\nAnd held dominion in Sicilian fields:<br>\nDrawing upon itself the upturned faces<br>\nOf neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar<br>\nThe skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,<br>\nAnd filled their bosoms with dread anxiety<br>\nOf what new thing nature were travailing at.</p>\n<p>In these affairs it much behooveth thee<br>\nTo look both wide and deep, and far abroad<br>\nTo peer to every quarter, that thou mayst<br>\nRemember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,<br>\nAnd mark how infinitely small a part<br>\nOf the whole Sum is this one sky of ours—<br>\nO not so large a part as is one man<br>\nOf the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest<br>\nThis cosmic fact, placing it square in front,<br>\nAnd plainly understandest, thou wilt leave<br>\nWondering at many things. For who of us<br>\nWondereth if some one gets into his joints<br>\nA fever, gathering head with fiery heat,<br>\nOr any other dolorous disease<br>\nAlong his members? For anon the foot<br>\nGrows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge<br>\nSeizes the teeth, attacks the very eyes;<br>\nOut-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on<br>\nOver the body, burneth every part<br>\nIt seizeth on, and works its hideous way<br>\nAlong the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,<br>\nOf things innumerable be seeds enough,<br>\nAnd this our earth and sky do bring to us<br>\nEnough of bane from whence can grow the strength<br>\nOf maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,<br>\nWe must suppose to all the sky and earth<br>\nAre ever supplied from out the infinite<br>\nAll things, O all in stores enough whereby<br>\nThe shaken earth can of a sudden move,<br>\nAnd fierce typhoons can over sea and lands<br>\nGo tearing on, and Aetna’s fires o’erflow,<br>\nAnd heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too,<br>\nHappens at times, and the celestial vaults<br>\nGlow into fire, and rainy tempests rise<br>\nIn heavier congregation, when, percase,<br>\nThe seeds of water have foregathered thus<br>\nFrom out the infinite. “Aye, but passing huge<br>\nThe fiery turmoil of that conflagration!”<br>\nSo sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems<br>\nTo him that erstwhile ne’er a larger saw;<br>\nThus, huge seems tree or man; and everything<br>\nWhich mortal sees the biggest of each class,<br>\nThat he imagines to be “huge”; though yet<br>\nAll these, with sky and land and sea to boot,<br>\nAre all as nothing to the sum entire<br>\nOf the all-Sum.</p>\n<p>               But now I will unfold<br>\nAt last how yonder suddenly angered flame<br>\nOut-blows abroad from vasty furnaces<br>\nAetnaean. First, the mountain’s nature is<br>\nAll under-hollow, propped about, about<br>\nWith caverns of basaltic piers. And, lo,<br>\nIn all its grottos be there wind and air—<br>\nFor wind is made when air hath been uproused<br>\nBy violent agitation. When this air<br>\nIs heated through and through, and, raging round,<br>\nHath made the earth and all the rocks it touches<br>\nHorribly hot, and hath struck off from them<br>\nFierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself<br>\nAnd hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat<br>\nInto high heav’n, and thus bears on afar<br>\nIts burning blasts and scattereth afar<br>\nIts ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk<br>\nAnd heaveth the while boulders of wondrous weight—<br>\nLeaving no doubt in thee that ‘tis the air’s<br>\nTumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part,<br>\nThe sea there at the roots of that same mount<br>\nBreaks its old billows and sucks back its surf.<br>\nAnd grottos from the sea pass in below<br>\nEven to the bottom of the mountain’s throat.<br>\nHerethrough thou must admit there go…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And the conditions force [the water and air]<br>\nDeeply to penetrate from the open sea,<br>\nAnd to out-blow abroad, and to up-bear<br>\nThereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps<br>\nThe boulders, and to rear the clouds of sand.<br>\nFor at the top be “bowls,” as people there<br>\nAre wont to name what we at Rome do call<br>\nThe throats and mouths.</p>\n<p>                      There be, besides, some thing<br>\nOf which ‘tis not enough one only cause<br>\nTo state—but rather several, whereof one<br>\nWill be the true: lo, if thou shouldst espy<br>\nLying afar some fellow’s lifeless corse,<br>\n‘Twere meet to name all causes of a death,<br>\nThat cause of his death might thereby be named:<br>\nFor prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,<br>\nBy cold, nor even by poison nor disease,<br>\nYet somewhat of this sort hath come to him<br>\nWe know—And thus we have to say the same<br>\nIn divers cases.</p>\n<p>                 Toward the summer, Nile<br>\nWaxeth and overfloweth the champaign,<br>\nUnique in all the landscape, river sole<br>\nOf the Aegyptians. In mid-season heats<br>\nOften and oft he waters Aegypt o’er,<br>\nEither because in summer against his mouths<br>\nCome those northwinds which at that time of year<br>\nMen name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus<br>\nUpstream, retard, and, forcing back his waves,<br>\nFill him o’erfull and force his flow to stop.<br>\nFor out of doubt these blasts which driven be<br>\nFrom icy constellations of the pole<br>\nAre borne straight up the river. Comes that river<br>\nFrom forth the sultry places down the south,<br>\nRising far up in midmost realm of day,<br>\nAmong black generations of strong men<br>\nWith sun-baked skins. ‘Tis possible, besides,<br>\nThat a big bulk of piled sand may bar<br>\nHis mouths against his onward waves, when sea,<br>\nWild in the winds, tumbles the sand to inland;<br>\nWhereby the river’s outlet were less free,<br>\nLikewise less headlong his descending floods.<br>\nIt may be, too, that in this season rains<br>\nAre more abundant at its fountain head,<br>\nBecause the Etesian blasts of those northwinds<br>\nThen urge all clouds into those inland parts.<br>\nAnd, soothly, when they’re thus foregathered there,<br>\nUrged yonder into midmost realm of day,<br>\nThen, crowded against the lofty mountain sides,<br>\nThey’re massed and powerfully pressed. Again,<br>\nPerchance, his waters wax, O far away,<br>\nAmong the Aethiopians’ lofty mountains,<br>\nWhen the all-beholding sun with thawing beams<br>\nDrives the white snows to flow into the vales.</p>\n<p>Now come; and unto thee I will unfold,<br>\nAs to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,<br>\nWhat sort of nature they are furnished with.<br>\nFirst, as to name of “birdless,“—that derives<br>\nFrom very fact, because they noxious be<br>\nUnto all birds. For when above those spots<br>\nIn horizontal flight the birds have come,<br>\nForgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,<br>\nAnd, with down-drooping of their delicate necks,<br>\nFall headlong into earth, if haply such<br>\nThe nature of the spots, or into water,<br>\nIf haply spreads thereunder Birdless tarn.<br>\nSuch spot’s at Cumae, where the mountains smoke,<br>\nCharged with the pungent sulphur, and increased<br>\nWith steaming springs. And such a spot there is<br>\nWithin the walls of Athens, even there<br>\nOn summit of Acropolis, beside<br>\nFane of Tritonian Pallas bountiful,<br>\nWhere never cawing crows can wing their course,<br>\nNot even when smoke the altars with good gifts,—<br>\nBut evermore they flee—yet not from wrath<br>\nOf Pallas, grieved at that espial old,<br>\nAs poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;<br>\nBut very nature of the place compels.<br>\nIn Syria also—as men say—a spot<br>\nIs to be seen, where also four-foot kinds,<br>\nAs soon as ever they’ve set their steps within,<br>\nCollapse, o’ercome by its essential power,<br>\nAs if there slaughtered to the under-gods.<br>\nLo, all these wonders work by natural law,<br>\nAnd from what causes they are brought to pass<br>\nThe origin is manifest; so, haply,<br>\nLet none believe that in these regions stands<br>\nThe gate of Orcus, nor us then suppose,<br>\nHaply, that thence the under-gods draw down<br>\nSouls to dark shores of Acheron—as stags,<br>\nThe wing-footed, are thought to draw to light,<br>\nBy sniffing nostrils, from their dusky lairs<br>\nThe wriggling generations of wild snakes.<br>\nHow far removed from true reason is this,<br>\nPerceive thou straight; for now I’ll try to say<br>\nSomewhat about the very fact.</p>\n<p>                              And, first,<br>\nThis do I say, as oft I’ve said before:<br>\nIn earth are atoms of things of every sort;<br>\nAnd know, these all thus rise from out the earth—<br>\nMany life-giving which be good for food,<br>\nAnd many which can generate disease<br>\nAnd hasten death, O many primal seeds<br>\nOf many things in many modes—since earth<br>\nContains them mingled and gives forth discrete.<br>\nAnd we have shown before that certain things<br>\nBe unto certain creatures suited more<br>\nFor ends of life, by virtue of a nature,<br>\nA texture, and primordial shapes, unlike<br>\nFor kinds alike. Then too ‘tis thine to see<br>\nHow many things oppressive be and foul<br>\nTo man, and to sensation most malign:<br>\nMany meander miserably through ears;<br>\nMany in-wind athrough the nostrils too,<br>\nMalign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;<br>\nOf not a few must one avoid the touch;<br>\nOf not a few must one escape the sight;<br>\nAnd some there be all loathsome to the taste;<br>\nAnd many, besides, relax the languid limbs<br>\nAlong the frame, and undermine the soul<br>\nIn its abodes within. To certain trees<br>\nThere hath been given so dolorous a shade<br>\nThat often they gender achings of the head,<br>\nIf one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.<br>\nThere is, again, on Helicon’s high hills<br>\nA tree that’s wont to kill a man outright<br>\nBy fetid odour of its very flower.<br>\nAnd when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,<br>\nExtinguished but a moment since, assails<br>\nThe nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep<br>\nA man afflicted with the falling sickness<br>\nAnd foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,<br>\nAt the heavy castor drowses back in chair,<br>\nAnd from her delicate fingers slips away<br>\nHer gaudy handiwork, if haply she<br>\nHath got the whiff at menstruation-time.<br>\nOnce more, if thou delayest in hot baths,<br>\nWhen thou art over-full, how readily<br>\nFrom stool in middle of the steaming water<br>\nThou tumblest in a fit! How readily<br>\nThe heavy fumes of charcoal wind their way<br>\nInto the brain, unless beforehand we<br>\nOf water ‘ve drunk. But when a burning fever,<br>\nO’ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs,<br>\nThen odour of wine is like a hammer-blow.<br>\nAnd seest thou not how in the very earth<br>\nSulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens<br>\nWith noisome stench?—What direful stenches, too,<br>\nScaptensula out-breathes from down below,<br>\nWhen men pursue the veins of silver and gold,<br>\nWith pick-axe probing round the hidden realms<br>\nDeep in the earth?—Or what of deadly bane<br>\nThe mines of gold exhale? O what a look,<br>\nAnd what a ghastly hue they give to men!<br>\nAnd seest thou not, or hearest, how they’re wont<br>\nIn little time to perish, and how fail<br>\nThe life-stores in those folk whom mighty power<br>\nOf grim necessity confineth there<br>\nIn such a task? Thus, this telluric earth<br>\nOut-streams with all these dread effluvia<br>\nAnd breathes them out into the open world<br>\nAnd into the visible regions under heaven.</p>\n<p>Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send<br>\nAn essence bearing death to winged things,<br>\nWhich from the earth rises into the breezes<br>\nTo poison part of skiey space, and when<br>\nThither the winged is on pennons borne,<br>\nThere, seized by the unseen poison, ‘tis ensnared,<br>\nAnd from the horizontal of its flight<br>\nDrops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium.<br>\nAnd when ‘thas there collapsed, then the same power<br>\nOf that effluvium takes from all its limbs<br>\nThe relics of its life. That power first strikes<br>\nThe creatures with a wildering dizziness,<br>\nAnd then thereafter, when they’re once down-fallen<br>\nInto the poison’s very fountains, then<br>\nLife, too, they vomit out perforce, because<br>\nSo thick the stores of bane around them fume.</p>\n<p>Again, at times it happens that this power,<br>\nThis exhalation of the Birdless places,<br>\nDispels the air betwixt the ground and birds,<br>\nLeaving well-nigh a void. And thither when<br>\nIn horizontal flight the birds have come,<br>\nForthwith their buoyancy of pennons limps,<br>\nAll useless, and each effort of both wings<br>\nFalls out in vain. Here, when without all power<br>\nTo buoy themselves and on their wings to lean,<br>\nLo, nature constrains them by their weight to slip<br>\nDown to the earth, and lying prostrate there<br>\nAlong the well-nigh empty void, they spend<br>\nTheir souls through all the openings of their frame.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Further, the water of wells is colder then<br>\nAt summer time, because the earth by heat<br>\nIs rarefied, and sends abroad in air<br>\nWhatever seeds it peradventure have<br>\nOf its own fiery exhalations.<br>\nThe more, then, the telluric ground is drained<br>\nOf heat, the colder grows the water hid<br>\nWithin the earth. Further, when all the earth<br>\nIs by the cold compressed, and thus contracts<br>\nAnd, so to say, concretes, it happens, lo,<br>\nThat by contracting it expresses then<br>\nInto the wells what heat it bears itself.</p>\n<p>‘Tis said at Hammon’s fane a fountain is,<br>\nIn daylight cold and hot in time of night.<br>\nThis fountain men be-wonder over-much,<br>\nAnd think that suddenly it seethes in heat<br>\nBy intense sun, the subterranean, when<br>\nNight with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands—<br>\nWhat’s not true reasoning by a long remove:<br>\nI’ faith when sun o’erhead, touching with beams<br>\nAn open body of water, had no power<br>\nTo render it hot upon its upper side,<br>\nThough his high light possess such burning glare,<br>\nHow, then, can he, when under the gross earth,<br>\nMake water boil and glut with fiery heat?—<br>\nAnd, specially, since scarcely potent he<br>\nThrough hedging walls of houses to inject<br>\nHis exhalations hot, with ardent rays.<br>\nWhat, then’s, the principle? Why, this, indeed:<br>\nThe earth about that spring is porous more<br>\nThan elsewhere the telluric ground, and be<br>\nMany the seeds of fire hard by the water;<br>\nOn this account, when night with dew-fraught shades<br>\nHath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down<br>\nGrows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out<br>\nInto the spring what seeds she holds of fire<br>\n(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot<br>\nThe touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,<br>\nUp-risen, with his rays has split the soil<br>\nAnd rarefied the earth with waxing heat,<br>\nAgain into their ancient abodes return<br>\nThe seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water<br>\nInto the earth retires; and this is why<br>\nThe fountain in the daylight gets so cold.<br>\nBesides, the water’s wet is beat upon<br>\nBy rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes<br>\nRarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;<br>\nAnd, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire<br>\nIt renders up, even as it renders oft<br>\nThe frost that it contains within itself<br>\nAnd thaws its ice and looseneth the knots.<br>\nThere is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind<br>\nThat makes a bit of tow (above it held)<br>\nTake fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too,<br>\nA pitch-pine torch will kindle and flare round<br>\nAlong its waves, wherever ‘tis impelled<br>\nAfloat before the breeze. No marvel, this:<br>\nBecause full many seeds of heat there be<br>\nWithin the water; and, from earth itself<br>\nOut of the deeps must particles of fire<br>\nAthrough the entire fountain surge aloft,<br>\nAnd speed in exhalations into air<br>\nForth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow<br>\nAs to make hot the fountain). And, moreo’er,<br>\nSome force constrains them, scattered through the water,<br>\nForthwith to burst abroad, and to combine<br>\nIn flame above. Even as a fountain far<br>\nThere is at Aradus amid the sea,<br>\nWhich bubbles out sweet water and disparts<br>\nFrom round itself the salt waves; and, behold,<br>\nIn many another region the broad main<br>\nYields to the thirsty mariners timely help,<br>\nBelching sweet waters forth amid salt waves.<br>\nJust so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth<br>\nAthrough that other fount, and bubble out<br>\nAbroad against the bit of tow; and when<br>\nThey there collect or cleave unto the torch,<br>\nForthwith they readily flash aflame, because<br>\nThe tow and torches, also, in themselves<br>\nHave many seeds of latent fire. Indeed,<br>\nAnd seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps<br>\nThou bringest a flaxen wick, extinguished<br>\nA moment since, it catches fire before<br>\n‘Thas touched the flame, and in same wise a torch?<br>\nAnd many another object flashes aflame<br>\nWhen at a distance, touched by heat alone,<br>\nBefore ‘tis steeped in veritable fire.<br>\nThis, then, we must suppose to come to pass<br>\nIn that spring also.</p>\n<p>                   Now to other things!<br>\nAnd I’ll begin to treat by what decree<br>\nOf nature it came to pass that iron can be<br>\nBy that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet call<br>\nAfter the country’s name (its origin<br>\nBeing in country of Magnesian folk).<br>\nThis stone men marvel at; and sure it oft<br>\nMaketh a chain of rings, depending, lo,<br>\nFrom off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times<br>\nFive or yet more in order dangling down<br>\nAnd swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one<br>\nDepends from other, cleaving to under-side,<br>\nAnd ilk one feels the stone’s own power and bonds—<br>\nSo over-masteringly its power flows down.</p>\n<p>In things of this sort, much must be made sure<br>\nEre thou account of the thing itself canst give,<br>\nAnd the approaches roundabout must be;<br>\nWherefore the more do I exact of thee<br>\nA mind and ears attent.</p>\n<p>                      First, from all things<br>\nWe see soever, evermore must flow,<br>\nMust be discharged and strewn about, about,<br>\nBodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.<br>\nFrom certain things flow odours evermore,<br>\nAs cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray<br>\nFrom waves of ocean, eater-out of walls<br>\nAlong the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep<br>\nThe varied echoings athrough the air.<br>\nThen, too, there comes into the mouth at times<br>\nThe wet of a salt taste, when by the sea<br>\nWe roam about; and so, whene’er we watch<br>\nThe wormwood being mixed, its bitter stings.<br>\nTo such degree from all things is each thing<br>\nBorne streamingly along, and sent about<br>\nTo every region round; and nature grants<br>\nNor rest nor respite of the onward flow,<br>\nSince ‘tis incessantly we feeling have,<br>\nAnd all the time are suffered to descry<br>\nAnd smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.</p>\n<p>Now will I seek again to bring to mind<br>\nHow porous a body all things have—a fact<br>\nMade manifest in my first canto, too.<br>\nFor, truly, though to know this doth import<br>\nFor many things, yet for this very thing<br>\nOn which straightway I’m going to discourse,<br>\n‘Tis needful most of all to make it sure<br>\nThat naught’s at hand but body mixed with void.<br>\nA first ensample: in grottos, rocks o’erhead<br>\nSweat moisture and distil the oozy drops;<br>\nLikewise, from all our body seeps the sweat;<br>\nThere grows the beard, and along our members all<br>\nAnd along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins<br>\nDisseminates the foods, and gives increase<br>\nAnd aliment down to the extreme parts,<br>\nEven to the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise,<br>\nThrough solid bronze the cold and fiery heat<br>\nWe feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass<br>\nThrough gold, through silver, when we clasp in hand<br>\nThe brimming goblets. And, again, there flit<br>\nVoices through houses’ hedging walls of stone;<br>\nOdour seeps through, and cold, and heat of fire<br>\nThat’s wont to penetrate even strength of iron.<br>\nAgain, where corselet of the sky girds round</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And at same time, some Influence of bane,<br>\nWhen from Beyond ‘thas stolen into [our world].<br>\nAnd tempests, gathering from the earth and sky,<br>\nBack to the sky and earth absorbed retire—<br>\nWith reason, since there’s naught that’s fashioned not<br>\nWith body porous.</p>\n<p>                Furthermore, not all<br>\nThe particles which be from things thrown off<br>\nAre furnished with same qualities for sense,<br>\nNor be for all things equally adapt.<br>\nA first ensample: the sun doth bake and parch<br>\nThe earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams<br>\nCompels the lofty snows, up-reared white<br>\nUpon the lofty hills, to waste away;<br>\nThen, wax, if set beneath the heat of him,<br>\nMelts to a liquid. And the fire, likewise,<br>\nWill melt the copper and will fuse the gold,<br>\nBut hides and flesh it shrivels up and shrinks.<br>\nThe water hardens the iron just off the fire,<br>\nBut hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens.<br>\nThe oleaster-tree as much delights<br>\nThe bearded she-goats, verily as though<br>\n‘Twere nectar-steeped and shed ambrosia;<br>\nThan which is naught that burgeons into leaf<br>\nMore bitter food for man. A hog draws back<br>\nFor marjoram oil, and every unguent fears<br>\nFierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,<br>\nYet unto us from time to time they seem,<br>\nAs ‘twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise,<br>\nThough unto us the mire be filth most foul,<br>\nTo hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem<br>\nThat they with wallowing from belly to back<br>\nAre never cloyed.</p>\n<p>                A point remains, besides,<br>\nWhich best it seems to tell of, ere I go<br>\nTo telling of the fact at hand itself.<br>\nSince to the varied things assigned be<br>\nThe many pores, those pores must be diverse<br>\nIn nature one from other, and each have<br>\nIts very shape, its own direction fixed.<br>\nAnd so, indeed, in breathing creatures be<br>\nThe several senses, of which each takes in<br>\nUnto itself, in its own fashion ever,<br>\nIts own peculiar object. For we mark<br>\nHow sounds do into one place penetrate,<br>\nInto another flavours of all juice,<br>\nAnd savour of smell into a third. Moreover,<br>\nOne sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo,<br>\nOne sort to pass through wood, another still<br>\nThrough gold, and others to go out and off<br>\nThrough silver and through glass. For we do see<br>\nThrough some pores form-and-look of things to flow,<br>\nThrough others heat to go, and some things still<br>\nTo speedier pass than others through same pores.<br>\nOf verity, the nature of these same paths,<br>\nVarying in many modes (as aforesaid)<br>\nBecause of unlike nature and warp and woof<br>\nOf cosmic things, constrains it so to be.<br></p>\n<p>Wherefore, since all these matters now have been<br>\nEstablished and settled well for us<br>\nAs premises prepared, for what remains<br>\n‘Twill not be hard to render clear account<br>\nBy means of these, and the whole cause reveal<br>\nWhereby the magnet lures the strength of iron.<br>\nFirst, stream there must from off the lode-stone seeds<br>\nInnumerable, a very tide, which smites<br>\nBy blows that air asunder lying betwixt<br>\nThe stone and iron. And when is emptied out<br>\nThis space, and a large place between the two<br>\nIs made a void, forthwith the primal germs<br>\nOf iron, headlong slipping, fall conjoined<br>\nInto the vacuum, and the ring itself<br>\nBy reason thereof doth follow after and go<br>\nThuswise with all its body. And naught there is<br>\nThat of its own primordial elements<br>\nMore thoroughly knit or tighter linked coheres<br>\nThan nature and cold roughness of stout iron.<br>\nWherefore, ‘tis less a marvel what I said,<br>\nThat from such elements no bodies can<br>\nFrom out the iron collect in larger throng<br>\nAnd be into the vacuum borne along,<br>\nWithout the ring itself do follow after.<br>\nAnd this it does, and followeth on until<br>\n‘Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it<br>\nBy links invisible. Moreover, likewise,<br>\nThe motion’s assisted by a thing of aid<br>\n(Whereby the process easier becomes),—<br>\nNamely, by this: as soon as rarer grows<br>\nThat air in front of the ring, and space between<br>\nIs emptied more and made a void, forthwith<br>\nIt happens all the air that lies behind<br>\nConveys it onward, pushing from the rear.<br>\nFor ever doth the circumambient air<br>\nDrub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth<br>\nThe iron, because upon one side the space<br>\nLies void and thus receives the iron in.<br>\nThis air, whereof I am reminding thee,<br>\nWinding athrough the iron’s abundant pores<br>\nSo subtly into the tiny parts thereof,<br>\nShoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.<br>\nThe same doth happen in all directions forth:<br>\nFrom whatso side a space is made a void,<br>\nWhether from crosswise or above, forthwith<br>\nThe neighbour particles are borne along<br>\nInto the vacuum; for of verity,<br>\nThey’re set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,<br>\nNor by themselves of own accord can they<br>\nRise upwards into the air. Again, all things<br>\nMust in their framework hold some air, because<br>\nThey are of framework porous, and the air<br>\nEncompasses and borders on all things.<br>\nThus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored<br>\nIs tossed evermore in vexed motion,<br>\nAnd therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt<br>\nAnd shakes it up inside…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In sooth, that ring is thither borne along<br>\nTo where ‘thas once plunged headlong—thither, lo,<br>\nUnto the void whereto it took its start.</p>\n<p>It happens, too, at times that nature of iron<br>\nShrinks from this stone away, accustomed<br>\nBy turns to flee and follow. Yea, I’ve seen<br>\nThose Samothracian iron rings leap up,<br>\nAnd iron filings in the brazen bowls<br>\nSeethe furiously, when underneath was set<br>\nThe magnet stone. So strongly iron seems<br>\nTo crave to flee that rock. Such discord great<br>\nIs gendered by the interposed brass,<br>\nBecause, forsooth, when first the tide of brass<br>\nHath seized upon and held possession of<br>\nThe iron’s open passage-ways, thereafter<br>\nCometh the tide of the stone, and in that iron<br>\nFindeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes<br>\nTo swim through, as before. ‘Tis thus constrained<br>\nWith its own current ‘gainst the iron’s fabric<br>\nTo dash and beat; by means whereof it spues<br>\nForth from itself—and through the brass stirs up—<br>\nThe things which otherwise without the brass<br>\nIt sucks into itself. In these affairs<br>\nMarvel thou not that from this stone the tide<br>\nPrevails not likewise other things to move<br>\nWith its own blows: for some stand firm by weight,<br>\nAs gold; and some cannot be moved forever,<br>\nBecause so porous in their framework they<br>\nThat there the tide streams through without a break,<br>\nOf which sort stuff of wood is seen to be.<br>\nTherefore, when iron (which lies between the two)<br>\nHath taken in some atoms of the brass,<br>\nThen do the streams of that Magnesian rock<br>\nMove iron by their smitings.</p>\n<p>                           Yet these things<br>\nAre not so alien from others, that I<br>\nOf this same sort am ill prepared to name<br>\nEnsamples still of things exclusively<br>\nTo one another adapt. Thou seest, first,<br>\nHow lime alone cementeth stones: how wood<br>\nOnly by glue-of-bull with wood is joined—<br>\nSo firmly too that oftener the boards<br>\nCrack open along the weakness of the grain<br>\nEre ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold.<br>\nThe vine-born juices with the water-springs<br>\nAre bold to mix, though not the heavy pitch<br>\nWith the light oil-of-olive. And purple dye<br>\nOf shell-fish so uniteth with the wool’s<br>\nBody alone that it cannot be ta’en<br>\nAway forever—nay, though thou gavest toil<br>\nTo restore the same with the Neptunian flood,<br>\nNay, though all ocean willed to wash it out<br>\nWith all its waves. Again, gold unto gold<br>\nDoth not one substance bind, and only one?<br>\nAnd is not brass by tin joined unto brass?<br>\nAnd other ensamples how many might one find!<br>\nWhat then? Nor is there unto thee a need<br>\nOf such long ways and roundabout, nor boots it<br>\nFor me much toil on this to spend. More fit<br>\nIt is in few words briefly to embrace<br>\nThings many: things whose textures fall together<br>\nSo mutually adapt, that cavities<br>\nTo solids correspond, these cavities<br>\nOf this thing to the solid parts of that,<br>\nAnd those of that to solid parts of this—<br>\nSuch joinings are the best. Again, some things<br>\nCan be the one with other coupled and held,<br>\nLinked by hooks and eyes, as ‘twere; and this<br>\nSeems more the fact with iron and this stone.<br>\nNow, of diseases what the law, and whence<br>\nThe Influence of bane upgathering can<br>\nUpon the race of man and herds of cattle<br>\nKindle a devastation fraught with death,<br>\nI will unfold. And, first, I’ve taught above<br>\nThat seeds there be of many things to us<br>\nLife-giving, and that, contrariwise, there must<br>\nFly many round bringing disease and death.<br>\nWhen these have, haply, chanced to collect<br>\nAnd to derange the atmosphere of earth,<br>\nThe air becometh baneful. And, lo, all<br>\nThat Influence of bane, that pestilence,<br>\nOr from Beyond down through our atmosphere,<br>\nLike clouds and mists, descends, or else collects<br>\nFrom earth herself and rises, when, a-soak<br>\nAnd beat by rains unseasonable and suns,<br>\nOur earth hath then contracted stench and rot.<br>\nSeest thou not, also, that whoso arrive<br>\nIn region far from fatherland and home<br>\nAre by the strangeness of the clime and waters<br>\nDistempered?—since conditions vary much.<br>\nFor in what else may we suppose the clime<br>\nAmong the Britons to differ from Aegypt’s own<br>\n(Where totters awry the axis of the world),<br>\nOr in what else to differ Pontic clime<br>\nFrom Gades’ and from climes adown the south,<br>\nOn to black generations of strong men<br>\nWith sun-baked skins? Even as we thus do see<br>\nFour climes diverse under the four main-winds<br>\nAnd under the four main-regions of the sky,<br>\nSo, too, are seen the colour and face of men<br>\nVastly to disagree, and fixed diseases<br>\nTo seize the generations, kind by kind:<br>\nThere is the elephant-disease which down<br>\nIn midmost Aegypt, hard by streams of Nile,<br>\nEngendered is—and never otherwhere.<br>\nIn Attica the feet are oft attacked,<br>\nAnd in Achaean lands the eyes. And so<br>\nThe divers spots to divers parts and limbs<br>\nAre noxious; ‘tis a variable air<br>\nThat causes this. Thus when an atmosphere,<br>\nAlien by chance to us, begins to heave,<br>\nAnd noxious airs begin to crawl along,<br>\nThey creep and wind like unto mist and cloud,<br>\nSlowly, and everything upon their way<br>\nThey disarrange and force to change its state.<br>\nIt happens, too, that when they’ve come at last<br>\nInto this atmosphere of ours, they taint<br>\nAnd make it like themselves and alien.<br>\nTherefore, asudden this devastation strange,<br>\nThis pestilence, upon the waters falls,<br>\nOr settles on the very crops of grain<br>\nOr other meat of men and feed of flocks.<br>\nOr it remains a subtle force, suspense<br>\nIn the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom<br>\nWe draw our inhalations of mixed air,<br>\nInto our body equally its bane<br>\nAlso we must suck in. In manner like,<br>\nOft comes the pestilence upon the kine,<br>\nAnd sickness, too, upon the sluggish sheep.<br>\nNor aught it matters whether journey we<br>\nTo regions adverse to ourselves and change<br>\nThe atmospheric cloak, or whether nature<br>\nHerself import a tainted atmosphere<br>\nTo us or something strange to our own use<br>\nWhich can attack us soon as ever it come.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/vi/the-plague-athens/\">BOOK VI - THE PLAGUE ATHENS</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In chief, men marvel nature renders not"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nSo vast the down-rush of the waters be,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd every river out of every realm"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nCometh thereto; and add the random rains"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd flying tempests, which spatter every sea"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd every land bedew; add their own springs:"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nYet all of these unto the ocean’s sum"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nShall be but as the increase of a drop."},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWherefore ‘tis less a marvel that the sea,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe mighty ocean, increaseth not.
