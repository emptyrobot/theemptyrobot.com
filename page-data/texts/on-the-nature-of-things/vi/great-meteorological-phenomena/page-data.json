For never a sound there comes<br>\nFrom out the serene regions of the sky;<br>\nBut wheresoever in a host more dense<br>\nThe clouds foregather, thence more often comes<br>\nA crash with mighty rumbling. And, again,<br>\nClouds cannot be of so condensed a frame<br>\nAs stones and timbers, nor again so fine<br>\nAs mists and flying smoke; for then perforce<br>\nThey’d either fall, borne down by their brute weight,<br>\nLike stones, or, like the smoke, they’d powerless be<br>\nTo keep their mass, or to retain within<br>\nFrore snows and storms of hail. And they give forth<br>\nO’er skiey levels of the spreading world<br>\nA sound on high, as linen-awning, stretched<br>\nO’er mighty theatres, gives forth at times<br>\nA cracking roar, when much ‘tis beaten about<br>\nBetwixt the poles and cross-beams. Sometimes, too,<br>\nAsunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves<br>\nAnd imitates the tearing sound of sheets<br>\nOf paper—even this kind of noise thou mayst<br>\nIn thunder hear—or sound as when winds whirl<br>\nWith lashings and do buffet about in air<br>\nA hanging cloth and flying paper-sheets.<br>\nFor sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds<br>\nCannot together crash head-on, but rather<br>\nMove side-wise and with motions contrary<br>\nGraze each the other’s body without speed,<br>\nFrom whence that dry sound grateth on our ears,<br>\nSo long drawn-out, until the clouds have passed<br>\nFrom out their close positions.</p>\n<p>                              And, again,<br>\nIn following wise all things seem oft to quake<br>\nAt shock of heavy thunder, and mightiest walls<br>\nOf the wide reaches of the upper world<br>\nThere on the instant to have sprung apart,<br>\nRiven asunder, what time a gathered blast<br>\nOf the fierce hurricane hath all at once<br>\nTwisted its way into a mass of clouds,<br>\nAnd, there enclosed, ever more and more<br>\nCompelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud<br>\nTo grow all hollow with a thickened crust<br>\nSurrounding; for thereafter, when the force<br>\nAnd the keen onset of the wind have weakened<br>\nThat crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,<br>\nGives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.<br>\nNo marvel this; since oft a bladder small,<br>\nFilled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,<br>\nGive forth a like large sound.</p>\n<p>                          There’s reason, too,<br>\nWhy clouds make sounds, as through them blow the winds:<br>\nWe see, borne down the sky, oft shapes of clouds<br>\nRough-edged or branched many forky ways;<br>\nAnd ‘tis the same, as when the sudden flaws<br>\nOf north-west wind through the dense forest blow,<br>\nMaking the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.<br>\nIt happens too at times that roused force<br>\nOf the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,<br>\nBreaking right through it by a front assault;<br>\nFor what a blast of wind may do up there<br>\nIs manifest from facts when here on earth<br>\nA blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees<br>\nAnd sucks them madly from their deepest roots.<br>\nBesides, among the clouds are waves, and these<br>\nGive, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar;<br>\nAs when along deep streams or the great sea<br>\nBreaks the loud surf. It happens, too, whenever<br>\nOut from one cloud into another falls<br>\nThe fiery energy of thunderbolt,<br>\nThat straightaway the cloud, if full of wet,<br>\nExtinguishes the fire with mighty noise;<br>\nAs iron, white from the hot furnaces,<br>\nSizzles, when speedily we’ve plunged its glow<br>\nDown the cold water. Further, if a cloud<br>\nMore dry receive the fire, ‘twill suddenly<br>\nKindle to flame and burn with monstrous sound,<br>\nAs if a flame with whirl of winds should range<br>\nAlong the laurel-tressed mountains far,<br>\nUpburning with its vast assault those trees;<br>\nNor is there aught that in the crackling flame<br>\nConsumes with sound more terrible to man<br>\nThan Delphic laurel of Apollo lord.<br>\nOft, too, the multitudinous crash of ice<br>\nAnd down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound<br>\nAmong the mighty clouds on high; for when<br>\nThe wind hath packed them close, each mountain mass<br>\nOf rain-cloud, there congealed utterly<br>\nAnd mixed with hail-stones, breaks and booms…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have struck,<br>\nBy their collision, forth the seeds of fire:<br>\nAs if a stone should smite a stone or steel,<br>\nFor light then too leaps forth and fire then scatters<br>\nThe shining sparks. But with our ears we get<br>\nThe thunder after eyes behold the flash,<br>\nBecause forever things arrive the ears<br>\nMore tardily than the eyes—as thou mayst see<br>\nFrom this example too: when markest thou<br>\nSome man far yonder felling a great tree<br>\nWith double-edged ax, it comes to pass<br>\nThine eye beholds the swinging stroke before<br>\nThe blow gives forth a sound athrough thine ears:<br>\nThus also we behold the flashing ere<br>\nWe hear the thunder, which discharged is<br>\nAt same time with the fire and by same cause,<br>\nBorn of the same collision.</p>\n<p>                          In following wise<br>\nThe clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,<br>\nAnd the storm flashes with tremulous elan:<br>\nWhen the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling there,<br>\nHath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud<br>\nInto a hollow with a thickened crust,<br>\nIt becomes hot of own velocity:<br>\nJust as thou seest how motion will o’erheat<br>\nAnd set ablaze all objects,—verily<br>\nA leaden ball, hurtling through length of space,<br>\nEven melts. Therefore, when this same wind a-fire<br>\nHath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,<br>\nWhich, so to say, have been pressed out by force<br>\nOf sudden from the cloud;—and these do make<br>\nThe pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth<br>\nThe detonation which attacks our ears<br>\nMore tardily than aught which comes along<br>\nUnto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place—<br>\nAs know thou mayst—at times when clouds are dense<br>\nAnd one upon the other piled aloft<br>\nWith wonderful upheavings—nor be thou<br>\nDeceived because we see how broad their base<br>\nFrom underneath, and not how high they tower.<br>\nFor make thine observations at a time<br>\nWhen winds shall bear athwart the horizon’s blue<br>\nClouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,<br>\nOr when about the sides of mighty peaks<br>\nThou seest them one upon the other massed<br>\nAnd burdening downward, anchored in high repose,<br>\nWith the winds sepulchred on all sides round:<br>\nThen canst thou know their mighty masses, then<br>\nCanst view their caverns, as if builded there<br>\nOf beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes<br>\nIn gathered storm have filled utterly,<br>\nThen, prisoned in clouds, they rave around<br>\nWith mighty roarings, and within those dens<br>\nBluster like savage beasts, and now from here,<br>\nAnd now from there, send growlings through the clouds,<br>\nAnd seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,<br>\nAnd roll from ‘mid the clouds the seeds of fire,<br>\nAnd heap them multitudinously there,<br>\nAnd in the hollow furnaces within<br>\nWheel flame around, until from bursted cloud<br>\nIn forky flashes they have gleamed forth.</p>\n<p>Again, from following cause it comes to pass<br>\nThat yon swift golden hue of liquid fire<br>\nDarts downward to the earth: because the clouds<br>\nThemselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;<br>\nFor, when they be without all moisture, then<br>\nThey be for most part of a flamy hue<br>\nAnd a resplendent. And, indeed, they must<br>\nEven from the light of sun unto themselves<br>\nTake multitudinous seeds, and so perforce<br>\nRedden and pour their bright fires all abroad.<br>\nAnd therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,<br>\nHath forced and squeezed into one spot these clouds,<br>\nThey pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out,<br>\nWhich make to flash these colours of the flame.<br>\nLikewise, it lightens also when the clouds<br>\nGrow rare and thin along the sky; for, when<br>\nThe wind with gentle touch unravels them<br>\nAnd breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds<br>\nWhich make the lightnings must by nature fall;<br>\nAt such an hour the horizon lightens round<br>\nWithout the hideous terror of dread noise<br>\nAnd skiey uproar.</p>\n<p>                   To proceed apace,<br>\nWhat sort of nature thunderbolts possess<br>\nIs by their strokes made manifest and by<br>\nThe brand-marks of their searing heat on things,<br>\nAnd by the scorched scars exhaling round<br>\nThe heavy fumes of sulphur. For all these<br>\nAre marks, O not of wind or rain, but fire.<br>\nAgain, they often enkindle even the roofs<br>\nOf houses and inside the very rooms<br>\nWith swift flame hold a fierce dominion.<br>\nKnow thou that nature fashioned this fire<br>\nSubtler than fires all other, with minute<br>\nAnd dartling bodies,—a fire ‘gainst which there’s naught<br>\nCan in the least hold out: the thunderbolt,<br>\nThe mighty, passes through the hedging walls<br>\nOf houses, like to voices or a shout,—<br>\nThrough stones, through bronze it passes, and it melts<br>\nUpon the instant bronze and gold; and makes,<br>\nLikewise, the wines sudden to vanish forth,<br>\nThe wine-jars intact,—because, ye see,<br>\nIts heat arriving renders loose and porous<br>\nReadily all the wine—jar’s earthen sides,<br>\nAnd winding its way within, it scattereth<br>\nThe elements primordial of the wine<br>\nWith speedy dissolution—process which<br>\nEven in an age the fiery steam of sun<br>\nCould not accomplish, however puissant he<br>\nWith his hot coruscations: so much more<br>\nAgile and overpowering is this force.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now in what manner engendered are these things,<br>\nHow fashioned of such impetuous strength<br>\nAs to cleave towers asunder, and houses all<br>\nTo overtopple, and to wrench apart<br>\nTimbers and beams, and heroes’ monuments<br>\nTo pile in ruins and upheave amain,<br>\nAnd to take breath forever out of men,<br>\nAnd to o’erthrow the cattle everywhere,—<br>\nYes, by what force the lightnings do all this,<br>\nAll this and more, I will unfold to thee,<br>\nNor longer keep thee in mere promises.</p>\n<p>The bolts of thunder, then, must be conceived<br>\nAs all begotten in those crasser clouds<br>\nUp-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene<br>\nAnd from the clouds of lighter density,<br>\nNone are sent forth forever. That ‘tis so<br>\nBeyond a doubt, fact plain to sense declares:<br>\nTo wit, at such a time the densed clouds<br>\nSo mass themselves through all the upper air<br>\nThat we might think that round about all murk<br>\nHad parted forth from Acheron and filled<br>\nThe mighty vaults of sky—so grievously,<br>\nAs gathers thus the storm-clouds’ gruesome might,<br>\nDo faces of black horror hang on high—<br>\nWhen tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge.<br>\nBesides, full often also out at sea<br>\nA blackest thunderhead, like cataract<br>\nOf pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away<br>\nBulging with murkiness, down on the waves<br>\nFalls with vast uproar, and draws on amain<br>\nThe darkling tempests big with thunderbolts<br>\nAnd hurricanes, itself the while so crammed<br>\nTremendously with fires and winds, that even<br>\nBack on the lands the people shudder round<br>\nAnd seek for cover. Therefore, as I said,<br>\nThe storm must be conceived as o’er our head<br>\nTowering most high; for never would the clouds<br>\nO’erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark,<br>\nUnless up-builded heap on lofty heap,<br>\nTo shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds,<br>\nAs on they come, engulf with rain so vast<br>\nAs thus to make the rivers overflow<br>\nAnd fields to float, if ether were not thus<br>\nFurnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then,<br>\nHere be all things fulfilled with winds and fires—<br>\nHence the long lightnings and the thunders loud.<br>\nFor, verily, I’ve taught thee even now<br>\nHow cavernous clouds hold seeds innumerable<br>\nOf fiery exhalations, and they must<br>\nFrom off the sunbeams and the heat of these<br>\nTake many still. And so, when that same wind<br>\n(Which, haply, into one region of the sky<br>\nCollects those clouds) hath pressed from out the same<br>\nThe many fiery seeds, and with that fire<br>\nHath at the same time inter-mixed itself,<br>\nO then and there that wind, a whirlwind now,<br>\nDeep in the belly of the cloud spins round<br>\nIn narrow confines, and sharpens there inside<br>\nIn glowing furnaces the thunderbolt.<br>\nFor in a two-fold manner is that wind<br>\nEnkindled all: it trembles into heat<br>\nBoth by its own velocity and by<br>\nRepeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when<br>\nThe energy of wind is heated through<br>\nAnd the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped<br>\nDeeply within, O then the thunderbolt,<br>\nNow ripened, so to say, doth suddenly<br>\nSplinter the cloud, and the aroused flash<br>\nLeaps onward, lumining with forky light<br>\nAll places round. And followeth anon<br>\nA clap so heavy that the skiey vaults,<br>\nAs if asunder burst, seem from on high<br>\nTo engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake<br>\nPervades the lands, and ‘long the lofty skies<br>\nRun the far rumblings. For at such a time<br>\nNigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through,<br>\nAnd roused are the roarings,—from which shock<br>\nComes such resounding and abounding rain,<br>\nThat all the murky ether seems to turn<br>\nNow into rain, and, as it tumbles down,<br>\nTo summon the fields back to primeval floods:<br>\nSo big the rains that be sent down on men<br>\nBy burst of cloud and by the hurricane,<br>\nWhat time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt<br>\nThat cracks the cloud, flies forth along. At times<br>\nThe force of wind, excited from without,<br>\nSmiteth into a cloud already hot<br>\nWith a ripe thunderbolt. And when that wind<br>\nHath splintered that cloud, then down there cleaves forthwith<br>\nYon fiery coil of flame which still we call,<br>\nEven with our fathers’ word, a thunderbolt.<br>\nThe same thing haps toward every other side<br>\nWhither that force hath swept. It happens, too,<br>\nThat sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth<br>\nWithout all fire, yet in its voyage through space<br>\nIgniteth, whilst it comes along, along,—<br>\nLosing some larger bodies which cannot<br>\nPass, like the others, through the bulks of air,—<br>\nAnd, scraping together out of air itself<br>\nSome smaller bodies, carries them along,<br>\nAnd these, commingling, by their flight make fire:<br>\nMuch in the manner as oft a leaden ball<br>\nGrows hot upon its aery course, the while<br>\nIt loseth many bodies of stark cold<br>\nAnd taketh into itself along the air<br>\nNew particles of fire. It happens, too,<br>\nThat force of blow itself arouses fire,<br>\nWhen force of wind, a-cold and hurtled forth<br>\nWithout all fire, hath strook somewhere amain—<br>\nNo marvel, because, when with terrific stroke<br>\n‘Thas smitten, the elements of fiery-stuff<br>\nCan stream together from out the very wind<br>\nAnd, simultaneously, from out that thing<br>\nWhich then and there receives the stroke: as flies<br>\nThe fire when with the steel we hack the stone;<br>\nNor yet, because the force of steel’s a-cold,<br>\nRush the less speedily together there<br>\nUnder the stroke its seeds of radiance hot.<br>\nAnd therefore, thuswise must an object too<br>\nBe kindled by a thunderbolt, if haply<br>\n‘Thas been adapt and suited to the flames.<br>\nYet force of wind must not be rashly deemed<br>\nAs altogether and entirely cold—<br>\nThat force which is discharged from on high<br>\nWith such stupendous power; but if ‘tis not<br>\nUpon its course already kindled with fire,<br>\nIt yet arriveth warmed and mixed with heat.</p>\n<p>And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt<br>\nIs so tremendous, and with glide so swift<br>\nThose thunderbolts rush on and down, because<br>\nTheir roused force itself collects itself<br>\nFirst always in the clouds, and then prepares<br>\nFor the huge effort of their going-forth;<br>\nNext, when the cloud no longer can retain<br>\nThe increment of their fierce impetus,<br>\nTheir force is pressed out, and therefore flies<br>\nWith impetus so wondrous, like to shots<br>\nHurled from the powerful Roman catapults.<br>\nNote, too, this force consists of elements<br>\nBoth small and smooth, nor is there aught that can<br>\nWith ease resist such nature. For it darts<br>\nBetween and enters through the pores of things;<br>\nAnd so it never falters in delay<br>\nDespite innumerable collisions, but<br>\nFlies shooting onward with a swift elan.<br>\nNext, since by nature always every weight<br>\nBears downward, doubled is the swiftness then<br>\nAnd that elan is still more wild and dread,<br>\nWhen, verily, to weight are added blows,<br>\nSo that more madly and more fiercely then<br>\nThe thunderbolt shakes into shivers all<br>\nThat blocks its path, following on its way.<br>\nThen, too, because it comes along, along<br>\nWith one continuing elan, it must<br>\nTake on velocity anew, anew,<br>\nWhich still increases as it goes, and ever<br>\nAugments the bolt’s vast powers and to the blow<br>\nGives larger vigour; for it forces all,<br>\nAll of the thunder’s seeds of fire, to sweep<br>\nIn a straight line unto one place, as ‘twere,—<br>\nCasting them one by other, as they roll,<br>\nInto that onward course. Again, perchance,<br>\nIn coming along, it pulls from out the air<br>\nSome certain bodies, which by their own blows<br>\nEnkindle its velocity. And, lo,<br>\nIt comes through objects leaving them unharmed,<br>\nIt goes through many things and leaves them whole,<br>\nBecause the liquid fire flieth along<br>\nAthrough their pores. And much it does transfix,<br>\nWhen these primordial atoms of the bolt<br>\nHave fallen upon the atoms of these things<br>\nPrecisely where the intertwined atoms<br>\nAre held together. And, further, easily<br>\nBrass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,<br>\nBecause its force is so minutely made<br>\nOf tiny parts and elements so smooth<br>\nThat easily they wind their way within,<br>\nAnd, when once in, quickly unbind all knots<br>\nAnd loosen all the bonds of union there.</p>\n<p>And most in autumn is shaken the house of heaven,<br>\nThe house so studded with the glittering stars,<br>\nAnd the whole earth around—most too in spring<br>\nWhen flowery times unfold themselves: for, lo,<br>\nIn the cold season is there lack of fire,<br>\nAnd winds are scanty in the hot, and clouds<br>\nHave not so dense a bulk. But when, indeed,<br>\nThe seasons of heaven are betwixt these twain,<br>\nThe divers causes of the thunderbolt<br>\nThen all concur; for then both cold and heat<br>\nAre mixed in the cross-seas of the year,<br>\nSo that a discord rises among things<br>\nAnd air in vast tumultuosity<br>\nBillows, infuriate with the fires and winds—<br>\nOf which the both are needed by the cloud<br>\nFor fabrication of the thunderbolt.<br>\nFor the first part of heat and last of cold<br>\nIs the time of spring; wherefore must things unlike<br>\nDo battle one with other, and, when mixed,<br>\nTumultuously rage. And when rolls round<br>\nThe latest heat mixed with the earliest chill—<br>\nThe time which bears the name of autumn—then<br>\nLikewise fierce cold-spells wrestle with fierce heats.<br>\nOn this account these seasons of the year<br>\nAre nominated “cross-seas.”—And no marvel<br>\nIf in those times the thunderbolts prevail<br>\nAnd storms are roused turbulent in heaven,<br>\nSince then both sides in dubious warfare rage<br>\nTumultuously, the one with flames, the other<br>\nWith winds and with waters mixed with winds.</p>\n<p>This, this it is, O Memmius, to see through<br>\nThe very nature of fire-fraught thunderbolt;<br>\nO this it is to mark by what blind force<br>\nIt maketh each effect, and not, O not<br>\nTo unwind Etrurian scrolls oracular,<br>\nInquiring tokens of occult will of gods,<br>\nEven as to whence the flying flame hath come,<br>\nOr to which half of heaven it turns, or how<br>\nThrough walled places it hath wound its way,<br>\nOr, after proving its dominion there,<br>\nHow it hath speeded forth from thence amain,<br>\nOr what the thunderstroke portends of ill<br>\nFrom out high heaven. But if Jupiter<br>\nAnd other gods shake those refulgent vaults<br>\nWith dread reverberations and hurl fire<br>\nWhither it pleases each, why smite they not<br>\nMortals of reckless and revolting crimes,<br>\nThat such may pant from a transpierced breast<br>\nForth flames of the red levin—unto men<br>\nA drastic lesson?—why is rather he—<br>\nO he self-conscious of no foul offence—<br>\nInvolved in flames, though innocent, and clasped<br>\nUp-caught in skiey whirlwind and in fire?<br>\nNay, why, then, aim they at eternal wastes,<br>\nAnd spend themselves in vain?—perchance, even so<br>\nTo exercise their arms and strengthen shoulders?<br>\nWhy suffer they the Father’s javelin<br>\nTo be so blunted on the earth? And why<br>\nDoth he himself allow it, nor spare the same<br>\nEven for his enemies? O why most oft<br>\nAims he at lofty places? Why behold we<br>\nMarks of his lightnings most on mountain tops?<br>\nThen for what reason shoots he at the sea?—<br>\nWhat sacrilege have waves and bulk of brine<br>\nAnd floating fields of foam been guilty of?<br>\nBesides, if ‘tis his will that we beware<br>\nAgainst the lightning-stroke, why feareth he<br>\nTo grant us power for to behold the shot?<br>\nAnd, contrariwise, if wills he to o’erwhelm us,<br>\nQuite off our guard, with fire, why thunders he<br>\nOff in yon quarter, so that we may shun?<br>\nWhy rouseth he beforehand darkling air<br>\nAnd the far din and rumblings? And O how<br>\nCanst thou believe he shoots at one same time<br>\nInto diverse directions? Or darest thou<br>\nContend that never hath it come to pass<br>\nThat divers strokes have happened at one time?<br>\nBut oft and often hath it come to pass,<br>\nAnd often still it must, that, even as showers<br>\nAnd rains o’er many regions fall, so too<br>\nDart many thunderbolts at one same time.<br>\nAgain, why never hurtles Jupiter<br>\nA bolt upon the lands nor pours abroad<br>\nClap upon clap, when skies are cloudless all?<br>\nOr, say, doth he, so soon as ever the clouds<br>\nHave come thereunder, then into the same<br>\nDescend in person, that from thence he may<br>\nNear-by decide upon the stroke of shaft?<br>\nAnd, lastly, why, with devastating bolt<br>\nShakes he asunder holy shrines of gods<br>\nAnd his own thrones of splendour, and to-breaks<br>\nThe well-wrought idols of divinities,<br>\nAnd robs of glory his own images<br>\nBy wound of violence?</p>\n<p>                    But to return apace,<br>\nEasy it is from these same facts to know<br>\nIn just what wise those things (which from their sort<br>\nThe Greeks have named “bellows”) do come down,<br>\nDischarged from on high, upon the seas.<br>\nFor it haps that sometimes from the sky descends<br>\nUpon the seas a column, as if pushed,<br>\nRound which the surges seethe, tremendously<br>\nAroused by puffing gusts; and whatso’er<br>\nOf ships are caught within that tumult then<br>\nCome into extreme peril, dashed along.<br>\nThis haps when sometimes wind’s aroused force<br>\nCan’t burst the cloud it tries to, but down-weighs<br>\nThat cloud, until ‘tis like a column from sky<br>\nUpon the seas pushed downward—gradually,<br>\nAs if a Somewhat from on high were shoved<br>\nBy fist and nether thrust of arm, and lengthened<br>\nFar to the waves. And when the force of wind<br>\nHath rived this cloud, from out the cloud it rushes<br>\nDown on the seas, and starts among the waves<br>\nA wondrous seething, for the eddying whirl<br>\nDescends and downward draws along with it<br>\nThat cloud of ductile body. And soon as ever<br>\n‘Thas shoved unto the levels of the main<br>\nThat laden cloud, the whirl suddenly then<br>\nPlunges its whole self into the waters there<br>\nAnd rouses all the sea with monstrous roar,<br>\nConstraining it to seethe. It happens too<br>\nThat very vortex of the wind involves<br>\nItself in clouds, scraping from out the air<br>\nThe seeds of cloud, and counterfeits, as ‘twere,<br>\nThe “bellows” pushed from heaven. And when this shape<br>\nHath dropped upon the lands and burst apart,<br>\nIt belches forth immeasurable might<br>\nOf whirlwind and of blast. Yet since ‘tis formed<br>\nAt most but rarely, and on land the hills<br>\nMust block its way, ‘tis seen more oft out there<br>\nOn the broad prospect of the level main<br>\nAlong the free horizons.</p>\n<p>                       Into being<br>\nThe clouds condense, when in this upper space<br>\nOf the high heaven have gathered suddenly,<br>\nAs round they flew, unnumbered particles—<br>\nWorld’s rougher ones, which can, though interlinked<br>\nWith scanty couplings, yet be fastened firm,<br>\nThe one on other caught. These particles<br>\nFirst cause small clouds to form; and, thereupon,<br>\nThese catch the one on other and swarm in a flock<br>\nAnd grow by their conjoining, and by winds<br>\nAre borne along, along, until collects<br>\nThe tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer<br>\nThe mountain summits neighbour to the sky,<br>\nThe more unceasingly their far crags smoke<br>\nWith the thick darkness of swart cloud, because<br>\nWhen first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes<br>\nCan there behold them (tenuous as they be),<br>\nThe carrier-winds will drive them up and on<br>\nUnto the topmost summits of the mountain;<br>\nAnd then at last it happens, when they be<br>\nIn vaster throng upgathered, that they can<br>\nBy this very condensation lie revealed,<br>\nAnd that at same time they are seen to surge<br>\nFrom very vertex of the mountain up<br>\nInto far ether. For very fact and feeling,<br>\nAs we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear<br>\nThat windy are those upward regions free.<br>\nBesides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,<br>\nWhen in they take the clinging moisture, prove<br>\nThat nature lifts from over all the sea<br>\nUnnumbered particles. Whereby the more<br>\n‘Tis manifest that many particles<br>\nEven from the salt upheavings of the main<br>\nCan rise together to augment the bulk<br>\nOf massed clouds. For moistures in these twain<br>\nAre near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,<br>\nAs well as from the land itself, we see<br>\nUp-rising mists and steam, which like a breath<br>\nAre forced out from them and borne aloft,<br>\nTo curtain heaven with their murk, and make,<br>\nBy slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.<br>\nFor, in addition, lo, the heat on high<br>\nOf constellated ether burdens down<br>\nUpon them, and by sort of condensation<br>\nWeaveth beneath the azure firmament<br>\nThe reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,<br>\nThat hither to the skies from the Beyond<br>\nDo come those particles which make the clouds<br>\nAnd flying thunderheads. For I have taught<br>\nThat this their number is innumerable<br>\nAnd infinite the sum of the Abyss,<br>\nAnd I have shown with what stupendous speed<br>\nThose bodies fly and how they’re wont to pass<br>\nAmain through incommunicable space.<br>\nTherefore, ‘tis not exceeding strange, if oft<br>\nIn little time tempest and darkness cover<br>\nWith bulking thunderheads hanging on high<br>\nThe oceans and the lands, since everywhere<br>\nThrough all the narrow tubes of yonder ether,<br>\nYea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes<br>\nOf the great upper-world encompassing,<br>\nThere be for the primordial elements<br>\nExits and entrances.</p>\n<p>                    Now come, and how<br>\nThe rainy moisture thickens into being<br>\nIn the lofty clouds, and how upon the lands<br>\n‘Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers,<br>\nI will unfold. And first triumphantly<br>\nWill I persuade thee that up-rise together,<br>\nWith clouds themselves, full many seeds of water<br>\nFrom out all things, and that they both increase—<br>\nBoth clouds and water which is in the clouds—<br>\nIn like proportion, as our frames increase<br>\nIn like proportion with our blood, as well<br>\nAs sweat or any moisture in our members.<br>\nBesides, the clouds take in from time to time<br>\nMuch moisture risen from the broad marine,—<br>\nWhilst the winds bear them o’er the mighty sea,<br>\nLike hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,<br>\nEven from all rivers is there lifted up<br>\nMoisture into the clouds. And when therein<br>\nThe seeds of water so many in many ways<br>\nHave come together, augmented from all sides,<br>\nThe close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge<br>\nTheir rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,<br>\nThe wind’s force crowds them, and the very excess<br>\nOf storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)<br>\nGiveth an urge and pressure from above<br>\nAnd makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,<br>\nThe clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered<br>\nSmitten on top by heat of sun, they send<br>\nTheir rainy moisture, and distil their drops,<br>\nEven as the wax, by fiery warmth on top,<br>\nWasteth and liquefies abundantly.<br>\nBut comes the violence of the bigger rains<br>\nWhen violently the clouds are weighted down<br>\nBoth by their cumulated mass and by<br>\nThe onset of the wind. And rains are wont<br>\nTo endure awhile and to abide for long,<br>\nWhen many seeds of waters are aroused,<br>\nAnd clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream<br>\nIn piled layers and are borne along<br>\nFrom every quarter, and when all the earth<br>\nSmoking exhales her moisture. At such a time<br>\nWhen sun with beams amid the tempest-murk<br>\nHath shone against the showers of black rains,<br>\nThen in the swart clouds there emerges bright<br>\nThe radiance of the bow.</p>\n<p>                       And as to things<br>\nNot mentioned here which of themselves do grow<br>\nOr of themselves are gendered, and all things<br>\nWhich in the clouds condense to being—all,<br>\nSnow and the winds, hail and the hoar-frosts chill,<br>\nAnd freezing, mighty force—of lakes and pools<br>\nThe mighty hardener, and mighty check<br>\nWhich in the winter curbeth everywhere<br>\nThe rivers as they go—‘tis easy still,<br>\nSoon to discover and with mind to see<br>\nHow they all happen, whereby gendered,<br>\nWhen once thou well hast understood just what<br>\nFunctions have been vouchsafed from of old<br>\nUnto the procreant atoms of the world.<br>\nNow come, and what the law of earthquakes is<br>\nHearken, and first of all take care to know<br>\nThat the under-earth, like to the earth around us,<br>\nIs full of windy caverns all about;<br>\nAnd many a pool and many a grim abyss<br>\nShe bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs<br>\nAnd jagged scarps; and many a river, hid<br>\nBeneath her chine, rolls rapidly along<br>\nIts billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact<br>\nRequires that earth must be in every part<br>\nAlike in constitution. Therefore, earth,<br>\nWith these things underneath affixed and set,<br>\nTrembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,<br>\nWhen time hath undermined the huge caves,<br>\nThe subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,<br>\nAnd instantly from spot of that big jar<br>\nThere quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.<br>\nAnd with good reason: since houses on the street<br>\nBegin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart<br>\nOf no large weight; and, too, the furniture<br>\nWithin the house up-bounds, when a paving-block<br>\nGives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.<br>\nIt happens, too, when some prodigious bulk<br>\nOf age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes<br>\nInto tremendous pools of water dark,<br>\nThat the reeling land itself is rocked about<br>\nBy the water’s undulations; as a basin<br>\nSometimes won’t come to rest until the fluid<br>\nWithin it ceases to be rocked about<br>\nIn random undulations.</p>\n<p>                         And besides,<br>\nWhen subterranean winds, up-gathered there<br>\nIn the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,<br>\nAnd press with the big urge of mighty powers<br>\nAgainst the lofty grottos, then the earth<br>\nBulks to that quarter whither push amain<br>\nThe headlong winds. Then all the builded houses<br>\nAbove ground—and the more, the higher up-reared<br>\nUnto the sky—lean ominously, careening<br>\nInto the same direction; and the beams,<br>\nWrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.<br>\nYet dread men to believe that there awaits<br>\nThe nature of the mighty world a time<br>\nOf doom and cataclysm, albeit they see<br>\nSo great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!<br>\nAnd lest the winds blew back again, no force<br>\nCould rein things in nor hold from sure career<br>\nOn to disaster. But now because those winds<br>\nBlow back and forth in alternation strong,<br>\nAnd, so to say, rallying charge again,<br>\nAnd then repulsed retreat, on this account<br>\nEarth oftener threatens than she brings to pass<br>\nCollapses dire. For to one side she leans,<br>\nThen back she sways; and after tottering<br>\nForward, recovers then her seats of poise.<br>\nThus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs<br>\nMore than the middle stories, middle more<br>\nThan lowest, and the lowest least of all.</p>\n<p>Arises, too, this same great earth-quaking,<br>\nWhen wind and some prodigious force of air,<br>\nCollected from without or down within<br>\nThe old telluric deeps, have hurled themselves<br>\nAmain into those caverns sub-terrene,<br>\nAnd there at first tumultuously chafe<br>\nAmong the vasty grottos, borne about<br>\nIn mad rotations, till their lashed force<br>\nAroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there,<br>\nRiving the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm—<br>\nWhat once in Syrian Sidon did befall,<br>\nAnd once in Peloponnesian Aegium,<br>\nTwain cities which such out-break of wild air<br>\nAnd earth’s convulsion, following hard upon,<br>\nO’erthrew of old. And many a walled town,<br>\nBesides, hath fall’n by such omnipotent<br>\nConvulsions on the land, and in the sea<br>\nEngulfed hath sunken many a city down<br>\nWith all its populace. But if, indeed,<br>\nThey burst not forth, yet is the very rush<br>\nOf the wild air and fury-force of wind<br>\nThen dissipated, like an ague-fit,<br>\nThrough the innumerable pores of earth,<br>\nTo set her all a-shake—even as a chill,<br>\nWhen it hath gone into our marrow-bones,<br>\nSets us convulsively, despite ourselves,<br>\nA-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men<br>\nWith two-fold terror bustle in alarm<br>\nThrough cities to and fro: they fear the roofs<br>\nAbove the head; and underfoot they dread<br>\nThe caverns, lest the nature of the earth<br>\nSuddenly rend them open, and she gape,<br>\nHerself asunder, with tremendous maw,<br>\nAnd, all confounded, seek to chock it full<br>\nWith her own ruins. Let men, then, go on<br>\nFeigning at will that heaven and earth shall be<br>\nInviolable, entrusted evermore<br>\nTo an eternal weal: and yet at times<br>\nThe very force of danger here at hand<br>\nProds them on some side with this goad of fear—<br>\nThis among others—that the earth, withdrawn<br>\nAbruptly from under their feet, be hurried down,<br>\nDown into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things<br>\nBe following after, utterly fordone,<br>\nTill be but wrack and wreckage of a world.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/on-the-nature-of-things/vi/extraordinary-and-paradoxical-telluric-phenomena/\">BOOK VI - EXTRAORDINARY AND PARADOXICAL TELLURIC PHENOMENA</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"                 And so in first place, then,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWith thunder are shaken the blue deeps of heaven,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBecause the ethereal clouds, scudding aloft,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTogether clash, what time ‘gainst one another"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe winds are battling.
