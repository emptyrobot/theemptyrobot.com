For coming from afar,<br>\nRising in lands of Aegypt, traversing<br>\nReaches of air and floating fields of foam,<br>\nAt last on all Pandion’s folk it swooped;<br>\nWhereat by troops unto disease and death<br>\nWere they o’er-given. At first, they’d bear about<br>\nA skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain<br>\nRed with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats,<br>\nBlack on the inside, sweated oozy blood;<br>\nAnd the walled pathway of the voice of man<br>\nWas clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue,<br>\nThe mind’s interpreter, would trickle gore,<br>\nWeakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch.<br>\nNext when that Influence of bane had chocked,<br>\nDown through the throat, the breast, and streamed had<br>\nE’en into sullen heart of those sick folk,<br>\nThen, verily, all the fences of man’s life<br>\nBegan to topple. From the mouth the breath<br>\nWould roll a noisome stink, as stink to heaven<br>\nRotting cadavers flung unburied out.<br>\nAnd, lo, thereafter, all the body’s strength<br>\nAnd every power of mind would languish, now<br>\nIn very doorway of destruction.<br>\nAnd anxious anguish and ululation (mixed<br>\nWith many a groan) companioned alway<br>\nThe intolerable torments. Night and day,<br>\nRecurrent spasms of vomiting would rack<br>\nAlway their thews and members, breaking down<br>\nWith sheer exhaustion men already spent.<br>\nAnd yet on no one’s body couldst thou mark<br>\nThe skin with o’er-much heat to burn aglow,<br>\nBut rather the body unto touch of hands<br>\nWould offer a warmish feeling, and thereby<br>\nShow red all over, with ulcers, so to say,<br>\nInbranded, like the “sacred fires” o’erspread<br>\nAlong the members. The inward parts of men,<br>\nIn truth, would blaze unto the very bones;<br>\nA flame, like flame in furnaces, would blaze<br>\nWithin the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply<br>\nUnto their members light enough and thin<br>\nFor shift of aid—but coolness and a breeze<br>\nEver and ever. Some would plunge those limbs<br>\nOn fire with bane into the icy streams,<br>\nHurling the body naked into the waves;<br>\nMany would headlong fling them deeply down<br>\nThe water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth<br>\nAlready agape. The insatiable thirst<br>\nThat whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make<br>\nA goodly shower seem like to scanty drops.<br>\nRespite of torment was there none. Their frames<br>\nForspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear<br>\nWould Medicine mumble low, the while she saw<br>\nSo many a time men roll their eyeballs round,<br>\nStaring wide-open, unvisited of sleep,<br>\nThe heralds of old death. And in those months<br>\nWas given many another sign of death:<br>\nThe intellect of mind by sorrow and dread<br>\nDeranged, the sad brow, the countenance<br>\nFierce and delirious, the tormented ears<br>\nBeset with ringings, the breath quick and short<br>\nOr huge and intermittent, soaking sweat<br>\nA-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts<br>\nTainted with colour of crocus and so salt,<br>\nThe cough scarce wheezing through the rattling throat.<br>\nAye, and the sinews in the fingered hands<br>\nWere sure to contract, and sure the jointed frame<br>\nTo shiver, and up from feet the cold to mount<br>\nInch after inch: and toward the supreme hour<br>\nAt last the pinched nostrils, nose’s tip<br>\nA very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow,<br>\nSkin cold and hard, the shuddering grimace,<br>\nThe pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!—<br>\nO not long after would their frames lie prone<br>\nIn rigid death. And by about the eighth<br>\nResplendent light of sun, or at the most<br>\nOn the ninth flaming of his flambeau, they<br>\nWould render up the life. If any then<br>\nHad ‘scaped the doom of that destruction, yet<br>\nHim there awaited in the after days<br>\nA wasting and a death from ulcers vile<br>\nAnd black discharges of the belly, or else<br>\nThrough the clogged nostrils would there ooze along<br>\nMuch fouled blood, oft with an aching head:<br>\nHither would stream a man’s whole strength and flesh.<br>\nAnd whoso had survived that virulent flow<br>\nOf the vile blood, yet into thews of him<br>\nAnd into his joints and very genitals<br>\nWould pass the old disease. And some there were,<br>\nDreading the doorways of destruction<br>\nSo much, lived on, deprived by the knife<br>\nOf the male member; not a few, though lopped<br>\nOf hands and feet, would yet persist in life,<br>\nAnd some there were who lost their eyeballs: O<br>\nSo fierce a fear of death had fallen on them!<br>\nAnd some, besides, were by oblivion<br>\nOf all things seized, that even themselves they knew<br>\nNo longer. And though corpse on corpse lay piled<br>\nUnburied on ground, the race of birds and beasts<br>\nWould or spring back, scurrying to escape<br>\nThe virulent stench, or, if they’d tasted there,<br>\nWould languish in approaching death. But yet<br>\nHardly at all during those many suns<br>\nAppeared a fowl, nor from the woods went forth<br>\nThe sullen generations of wild beasts—<br>\nThey languished with disease and died and died.<br>\nIn chief, the faithful dogs, in all the streets<br>\nOutstretched, would yield their breath distressfully<br>\nFor so that Influence of bane would twist<br>\nLife from their members. Nor was found one sure<br>\nAnd universal principle of cure:<br>\nFor what to one had given the power to take<br>\nThe vital winds of air into his mouth,<br>\nAnd to gaze upward at the vaults of sky,<br>\nThe same to others was their death and doom.</p>\n<p>In those affairs, O awfullest of all,<br>\nO pitiable most was this, was this:<br>\nWhoso once saw himself in that disease<br>\nEntangled, ay, as damned unto death,<br>\nWould lie in wanhope, with a sullen heart,<br>\nWould, in fore-vision of his funeral,<br>\nGive up the ghost, O then and there. For, lo,<br>\nAt no time did they cease one from another<br>\nTo catch contagion of the greedy plague,—<br>\nAs though but woolly flocks and horned herds;<br>\nAnd this in chief would heap the dead on dead:<br>\nFor who forbore to look to their own sick,<br>\nO these (too eager of life, of death afeard)<br>\nWould then, soon after, slaughtering Neglect<br>\nVisit with vengeance of evil death and base—<br>\nThemselves deserted and forlorn of help.<br>\nBut who had stayed at hand would perish there<br>\nBy that contagion and the toil which then<br>\nA sense of honour and the pleading voice<br>\nOf weary watchers, mixed with voice of wail<br>\nOf dying folk, forced them to undergo.<br>\nThis kind of death each nobler soul would meet.<br>\nThe funerals, uncompanioned, forsaken,<br>\nLike rivals contended to be hurried through.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And men contending to ensepulchre<br>\nPile upon pile the throng of their own dead:<br>\nAnd weary with woe and weeping wandered home;<br>\nAnd then the most would take to bed from grief.<br>\nNor could be found not one, whom nor disease<br>\nNor death, nor woe had not in those dread times<br>\nAttacked.</p>\n<p>By now the shepherds and neatherds all,<br>\nYea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,<br>\nBegan to sicken, and their bodies would lie<br>\nHuddled within back-corners of their huts,<br>\nDelivered by squalor and disease to death.<br>\nO often and often couldst thou then have seen<br>\nOn lifeless children lifeless parents prone,<br>\nOr offspring on their fathers’, mothers’ corpse<br>\nYielding the life. And into the city poured<br>\nO not in least part from the countryside<br>\nThat tribulation, which the peasantry<br>\nSick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter,<br>\nPlague-stricken mob. All places would they crowd,<br>\nAll buildings too; whereby the more would death<br>\nUp-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town.<br>\nAh, many a body thirst had dragged and rolled<br>\nAlong the highways there was lying strewn<br>\nBesides Silenus-headed water-fountains,—<br>\nThe life-breath choked from that too dear desire<br>\nOf pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along<br>\nThe open places of the populace,<br>\nAnd along the highways, O thou mightest see<br>\nOf many a half-dead body the sagged limbs,<br>\nRough with squalor, wrapped around with rags,<br>\nPerish from very nastiness, with naught<br>\nBut skin upon the bones, well-nigh already<br>\nBuried—in ulcers vile and obscene filth.<br>\nAll holy temples, too, of deities<br>\nHad Death becrammed with the carcasses;<br>\nAnd stood each fane of the Celestial Ones<br>\nLaden with stark cadavers everywhere—<br>\nPlaces which warders of the shrines had crowded<br>\nWith many a guest. For now no longer men<br>\nDid mightily esteem the old Divine,<br>\nThe worship of the gods: the woe at hand<br>\nDid over-master. Nor in the city then<br>\nRemained those rites of sepulture, with which<br>\nThat pious folk had evermore been wont<br>\nTo buried be. For it was wildered all<br>\nIn wild alarms, and each and every one<br>\nWith sullen sorrow would bury his own dead,<br>\nAs present shift allowed. And sudden stress<br>\nAnd poverty to many an awful act<br>\nImpelled; and with a monstrous screaming they<br>\nWould, on the frames of alien funeral pyres,<br>\nPlace their own kin, and thrust the torch beneath<br>\nOft brawling with much bloodshed round about<br>\nRather than quit dead bodies loved in life.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"‘Twas such a manner of disease, ‘twas such"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMortal miasma in Cecropian lands"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhilom reduced the plains to dead men’s bones,"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nUnpeopled the highways, drained of citizens"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe Athenian town.
