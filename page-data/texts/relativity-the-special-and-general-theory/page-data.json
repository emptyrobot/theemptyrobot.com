Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.\nI make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a “step-motherly” fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees.\nMay the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!</p>\n<p>December, 1916</p>\n<p>A.
