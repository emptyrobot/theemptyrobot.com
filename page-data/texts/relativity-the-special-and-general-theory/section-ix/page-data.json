Now in\nreality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is\nhastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding\non ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will\nsee the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that\nemitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their\nreference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the\nlightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We\nthus arrive at the important result:</p>\n<p>Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not\nsimultaneous with respect to the train, and vice versa (relativity of\nsimultaneity).

But we have just seen that this\nassumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of\nsimultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between\nthe law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of\nrelativity (developed in <a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-vi/\">Section VI</a>) disappears.</p>\n<p>We were led to that conflict by the considerations of <a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-vi/\">Section VI</a>,\nwhich are now no longer tenable.

But, according to the foregoing\nconsiderations, the time required by a particular occurrence with\nrespect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration\nof the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as\nreference-body).
