Those of you who have carefully\nfollowed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we\nshould retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so\nconvincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The\nlaw of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be\nreplaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of\nrelativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however,\nthat we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical\ninvestigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical\nphenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this\ndomain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of\nwhich the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a\nnecessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref\nore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of\nthe fact that no empirical data had been found which were\ncontradictory to this principle.</p>\n<p>At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a\nresult of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space,\nit became evident that <em>in realily there is not the least\nincompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of\npropagation of light</em>, and that by systematically holding fast to both\nthese laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory\nhas been called the <em>special theory of relativity</em> to distinguish it\nfrom the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the\nfollowing pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special\ntheory of relativity.</p>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-viii/\">VIII.\tOn the Idea of Time in Physics</a></p>\n</center>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which\nlight is propagated in empty space.
