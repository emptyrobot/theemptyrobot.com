The validity of the principle of relativity was\nassumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (<em>e.g.</em>\nthose possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak\nof the special principle of relativity, or special theory of\nrelativity.</p>\n<p>In contrast to this we wish to understand by the “general principle of\nrelativity” the following statement: All bodies of reference <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span></span></span></span>, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.751892em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.751892em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>,\netc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena\n(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their\nstate of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed\nout that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract\none, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been\njustified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must\nfeel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle\nof relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable\nconsideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate,\nthere is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine\nourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is\ntravelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly, the\noccupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for\nthis reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the\ncase as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in\nmotion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity,\nthis interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of\nview.</p>\n<p>If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform\nmotion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then\nthe occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful\njerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical\nbehaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage.\nThe mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously\nconsidered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that\nthe same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving\ncarriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in\nuniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does\nnot hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of\nthis, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of\nabsolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the\ngeneral principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see\nthat this conclusion cannot be maintained.</p>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-xix/\">XIX.\tThe Gravitational Field</a></p>\n</center>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous\nconsiderations, was the special principle of relativity, "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"i.e."}]},{"type":"text","value":" the\nprinciple of the physical relativity of all "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"uniform"}]},{"type":"text","value":" motion.
