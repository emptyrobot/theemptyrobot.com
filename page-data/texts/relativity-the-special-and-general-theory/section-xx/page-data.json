It is then\npossible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space\n(world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in\nmotion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As\nreference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with\nan observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation\nnaturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself\nwith strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the\nfloor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.</p>\n<p>To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with\nrope attached, and now a “being” (what kind of a being is immaterial\nto us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest\ntogether with the observer then begin to move “upwards” with a\nuniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will\nreach unheard-of values—provided that we are viewing all this from\nanother reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.</p>\n<p>But how does the man in the chest regard the Process? The\nacceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction\nof the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by\nmeans of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on\nthe floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as\nanyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he releases a body\nwhich he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will\nno longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body\nwill approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative\nmotion. The observer will further convince himself that the\nacceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of\nthe same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the\nexperiment.</p>\n<p>Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was\ndiscussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus\ncome to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational\nfield which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be\npuzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this\ngravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the\nmiddle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it,\nand he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is\nsuspended at rest in the gravitational field.</p>\n<p>Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?\nI do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent; we must\nrather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither\nreason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated\nwith respect to the “Galileian space” first considered, we can\nnevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good\ngrounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of\nreference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a\nresult we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate\nof relativity.</p>\n<p>We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of\ninterpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational\nfield of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to\nthe same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and\ngravitational mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the\naccelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the\nbodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he\nwould not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his\nreference-body to be “at rest.”</p>\n<p>Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of\nthe lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The\nresult of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang\n“vertically” downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of\ntension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: “The suspended\nbody experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this\nis neutralised by the tension of the rope; what determines the\nmagnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the\nsuspended body.” On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely\nin space will interpret the condition of things thus: “The rope must\nperforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it\ntransmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the\nrope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That\nwhich determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the\ninertial mass of the body.” Guided by this example, we see that our\nextension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the\nlaw of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have\nobtained a physical interpretation of this law.</p>\n<p>From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general\ntheory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of\ngravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general\nidea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the\ngravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn\nthe reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations.\nA gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the\nfact that there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first\nchosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a\ngravitational field is always only an apparent one. We might also\nthink that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be\npresent, we could always choose another reference-body such that no\ngravitational field exists with reference to it. This is by no means\ntrue for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special\nform. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference\nsuch that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in\nits entirety) vanishes.</p>\n<p>We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we\nbrought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend\nof <a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-xviii/\">Section XVIII</a>.
