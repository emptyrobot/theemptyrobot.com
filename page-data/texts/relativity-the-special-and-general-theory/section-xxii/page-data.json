It is\nknown that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in\nthis way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing\nessentially new.</p>\n<p>However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we\ncarry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light.

It can easily be shown that the\npath of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we\nconsider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body\n<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.751892em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.751892em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are\npropagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this\nresult is of great importance.</p>\n<p>In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a\ndetailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light\nrays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly\nsmall for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its\nestimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing\nincidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest\nitself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed\nstars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus\ncapable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such\ntimes, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the\nsun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent\nposition in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the\nheavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this\ndeduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution\nof which is to be expected of astronomers.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the second place our result shows that, according to the general\ntheory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of\nlight in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental\nassumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have\nalready frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A\ncurvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of\npropagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as\na consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it\nthe whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in\nreality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special\ntheory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity;\nits results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the\ninfluences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (<em>e.g.</em> of light).</p>\n<p>Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of\nrelativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the\ngeneral theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the\nfacts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison.\nBefore the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics\nwere looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we\nknow that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic\nconsiderations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in\nwhich the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each\nother, and to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying\nthat for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the\nfield-equations of Maxwell in electrodynamics? Not in the least.\nElectrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case;\nthe laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the\ncase in which the fields are invariable with regard to time. No fairer\ndestiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should\nof itself point out the way to the introduction of a more\ncomprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case.</p>\n<p>In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have\nseen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive\ntheoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of\nnatural processes, the Iaws of which are already known when a\ngravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the\nsolution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,\nconcerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational\nfield itself. Let us consider this for a moment.</p>\n<p>We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately)\nin a “Galileian” fashion under suitable choice of reference-body,\n<em>i.e.</em> domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer\nsuch a domain to a reference-body <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.751892em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.751892em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> possessing any kind of motion,\nthen relative to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.751892em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.751892em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> there exists a gravitational field which is\nvariable with respect to space and time.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>  The character of this\nfield will of course depend on the motion chosen for <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.751892em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.751892em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. According to\nthe general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational\nfield must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in\nthis way. Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be\nproduced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general\nlaw of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of\na special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful\nmanner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual\nrealisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as\nthis lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the\nreader.
