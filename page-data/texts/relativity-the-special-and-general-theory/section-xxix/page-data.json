In\norder to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still\nrequire to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can\nbe obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the\nfollowing demands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style:none\">\n<p>(a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general postulate of relativity.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none\">\n<p>(b) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its inertial mass, and thus according to <a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-xv/\">Section XV</a> only its energy is of importance for its etfect in exciting a field.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none\">\n<p>(c) Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of the conservation of energy (and of impulse).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine\nthe influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those\nprocesses which take place according to known laws when a\ngravitational field is absent <em>i.e.</em> which have already been fitted into\nthe frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we\nproceed in principle according to the method which has already been\nexplained for measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material\npoints.</p>\n<p>The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general\npostulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty; nor in\nremoving the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought\nto light in <a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-xxi/\">Section XXI</a>; nor in interpreting the empirical law of\nthe equality of inertial and gravitational mass; but it has also\nalready explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which\nclassical mechanics is powerless.</p>\n<p>If we confine the application of the theory to the case where the\ngravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all\nmasses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities\nwhich are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as\na first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is\nobtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to\nintroduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually\nattracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of\nthe distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the\ncalculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their\nappearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test\nof observation owing to their smallness.</p>\n<p>We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to\nNewton’s theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which\nwould permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed\nstars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves\nand the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we\ncorrect the observed motion of the planets for these two influences,\nand if Newton’s theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the\norbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the\nfixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy,\nhas been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision\nthat is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation\nattainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the\nplanet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has\nbeen known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury,\nafter it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not\nstationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates\nexceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the\norbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the\norbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured\nto be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be\nexplained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of\nhypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised\nsolely for this purponse.</p>\n<p>On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the\nellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the\nmanner indicated above; that for all the planets, with the exception\nof Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the\ndelicacy of observation possible at the present time; but that in the\ncase of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a\nresult which is strictly in agreement with observation.</p>\n<p>Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two\ndeductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation,\nto wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the\nsun<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching\nus from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for\nlight produced in an analogous manner terrestrially (<em>i.e.</em> by the same\nkind of atom)<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  These two deductions from the theory have both\nbeen confirmed.</p>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"/texts/relativity-the-special-and-general-theory/section-xxx/\">XXX.\tCosmological Difficulties of Newton’s Theory</a></p>\n</center>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>First observed by Eddington and others in 1919.
