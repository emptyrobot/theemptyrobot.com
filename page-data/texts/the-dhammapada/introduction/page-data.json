It is included in the canon of\nBuddhistic Scriptures, and is one of the Eastern books which can be read\nwith delight to-day by those who are classed as general readers. It is\ndivided into twenty-six chapters, and the keynote of it is struck by the\nsentence “The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in\nthe next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he\nhas done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.” The first\nstep in the “good path” is earnestness, for as the writer says,\n“Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness the\npath of death; those who are in earnest do not die, those who are\nthoughtless are as if dead already.” Earnestness, in this connection,\nevidently means the power of reflection, and of abstracting the mind\nfrom mundane things. There is something very inspiring in the sentence,\n“When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the wise,\nclimbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the fools: free\nfrom sorrow he looks upon the sorrowing crowd, as one that stands on a\nmountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.” This reminds\nus of Lucretius,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> “How sweet to stand, when tempests tear the main,<br>\nOn the firm cliff, and mark the seaman’s toil!<br>\nNot that another’s danger soothes the soul,<br>\nBut from such toil how sweet to feel secure!<br>\nHow sweet, at distance from the strife, to view<br>\nContending hosts, and hear the clash of war!<br>\nBut sweeter far on Wisdom’s height serene,<br>\nUpheld by Truth, to fix our firm abode;<br>\nTo watch the giddy crowd that, deep below,<br>\nForever wander in pursuit of bliss;<br>\nTo mark the strife for honors, and renown,<br>\nFor wit and wealth, insatiate, ceaseless urged,<br>\nDay after day, with labor unrestrained.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is curious to see the atheistic Epicurean and the devout Buddhist\nmeeting on a common ground. But the beauties of the “Dhammapada” can\nonly be realized by a careful study of this charming work. We would\npoint out, for instance, in the chapter on Flowers, what is a piece of\ngolden advice to all readers of books: “The disciple will find out the\nplainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds the right flower.”</p>\n<p>Neither the date nor the authorship of the “Dhammapada” is known, but\nthere is conclusive evidence that this canon existed before the\nChristian era. Many scholars agree in ascribing its utterances to Buddha\nhimself, while others are of the opinion that it is a compilation made\nby Buddhist monks from various sources.</p>\n<p>E.W.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/the-dhammapada/chapter-i-the-twin-verses/\">Chapter I - The Twin-Verses</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The “Dhammapada,” or “Path to Virtue,” is one of the most practical\nethical hand-books of Buddhism.
