Two substances, whose attributes are different, have nothing in common.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/iii/\">I-III. Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/iv/\">I-IV.

One substance cannot be produced by another substance.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/vii/\">I-VII. Existence belongs to the nature of substances.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/viii/\">I-VIII. Every substance is necessarily infinite.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/ix/\">I-IX. The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the number of its attributes (Def. iv.).</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/x/\">I-X. Each particular attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xi/\">I-XI. God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xii/\">I-XII. No attribute of substance can be conceived from which it would follow that substance can be divided.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xiii/\">I-XIII. Substance absolutely infinite is indivisible.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xiv/\">I-XIV. Besides God no substance can be granted or conceived.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xv/\">I-XV. Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xvi/\">I-XVI. From the necessity of the divine nature must follow an infinite number of things</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xvii/\">I-XVII. God acts solely by the laws of his own nature, and is not constrained by anyone.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xviii/\">I-XVIII. God is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xix/\">I-XIX. God, and all the attributes of God, are eternal.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xx/\">I-XX.

Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/i/xxix/\">I-XXIX.

Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/ii/\">II-II. Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/iii/\">II-III. In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his essence</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/iv/\">II-IV. The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/v/\">II-V. The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only in so far as he is considered</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/vi/\">II-VI. The modes of any given attribute are caused by God, in so far as he is considered</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/vii/\">II-VII. The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/viii/\">II-VIII. The ideas of particular things, or of modes, that do not exist</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/ix/\">II-IX. The idea of an individual thing actually existing is caused by God</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/x/\">II-X. The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xi/\">II-XI. The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xii/\">II-XII. Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea, which constitutes the human mind</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xiii/\">II-XIII. The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xiv/\">II-XIV. The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xv/\">II-XV. The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xvi/\">II-XVI. The idea of every mode, in which the human body is affected by external bodies</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xvii/\">II-XVII. If the human body is affected in a manner which involves the nature of any external body</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xviii/\">II-XVIII. If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xix/\">II-XIX. The human mind has no knowledge of the body, and does not know it to exist</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xx/\">II-XX. The idea or knowledge of the human mind is also in God</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxi/\">II-XXI. This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxii/\">II-XXII. The human mind perceives not only the modifications of the body, but also the ideas of such modifications.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxiii/\">II-XXIII. The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxiv/\">II-XXIV. The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the parts composing the human body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxv/\">II-XXV. The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the external body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxvi/\">II-XXVI. The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxvii/\">II-XXVII. The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxviii/\">II-XXVIII. The ideas of the modifications of the human body, in so far as</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxix/\">II-XXIX. The idea of the idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human mind.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxx/\">II-XXX. We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxi/\">II-XXXI. We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things external to ourselves.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxii/\">II-XXXII. All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God, are true.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxiii/\">II-XXXIII. There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them to be called false.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxiv/\">II-XXXIV. Every idea, which in us is absolute or adequate and perfect, is true.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxv/\">II-XXXV. Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxvi/\">II-XXXVI. Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxvii/\">II-XXXVII. That which is common to all (cf. Lemma II., above), and which is equally</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxviii/\">II-XXXVIII. Those things, which are common to all, and which are equally in a part</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xxxix/\">II-XXXIX. That, which is common to and a property of the human body and such other bodies</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xl/\">II-XL. Whatsoever ideas in the mind follow from ideas which are therein adequate, are also themselves adequate.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xli/\">II-XLI. Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity, knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily true.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlii/\">II-XLII. Knowledge of the second and third kinds, not knowledge of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish the true from the false.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xliii/\">II-XLIII. He, who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that he has a true idea, and cannot doubt of the truth of the thing perceived.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xliv/\">II-XLIV. It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent, but as necessary.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlv/\">II-XLV. Every idea of every body, or of every particular thing actually existing, necessarily involves the eternal and infinite essence of God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlvi/\">II-XLVI. The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God which every idea involves is adequate and perfect.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlvii/\">II-XLVII. The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlviii/\">II-XLVIII. In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/ii/xlviii/\">II-XLIX. There is in the mind no volition or affirmation and negation, save that which an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li></ul></li><li> \n</li></ul></li><li> \n<h2><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/\">III.

Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/ii/\">III-II. Body cannot determine mind to think, neither can mind determine body </a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/iii/\">III-III. The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/iv/\">III-IV. Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/v/\">III-V. Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/vi/\">III-VI. Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persist in its own being.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/vii/\">III-VII. The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being, is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/viii/\">III-VIII. The endeavour, whereby a thing endeavours to persist in its own being, involves no finite time, but an indefinite time.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/ix/\">III-IX. The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/x/\">III-X. An idea, which excludes the existence of our body, cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xi/\">III-XI. Whatsoever increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of activity in our body, the idea thereof increases or diminishes</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xii/\">III-XII. The mind, as far as it can, endeavours to conceive those things, which increase or help the power of activity in the body.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xiii/\">III-XIII. When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder the body’s power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xiv/\">III-XIV. If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xv/\">III-XV. Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xvi/\">III-XVI. Simply from the fact that we conceive, that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xvii/\">III-XVII. If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect us painfully, has any point of resemblance with another thing</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xviii/\">III-XVIII. A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xix/\">III-XIX. He who conceives that the object of his love is destroyed will feel pain; if he conceives that it is preserved he will feel pleasure.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xx/\">III-XX. He who conceives that the object of his hate is destroyed will also feel pleasure.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxi/\">III-XXI. He who conceives, that the object of his love is affected pleasurably or painfully, will himself be affected pleasurably or painfully</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxii/\">III-XXII.

When we love a thing similar to ourselves we endeavour, as far as we can, to bring about that it should love us in return.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxxiv/\">III-XXXIV. The greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected towards us, the greater will be our complacency.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxxv/\">III-XXXV. If anyone conceives, that an object of his love joins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he himself has attained to</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxxvi/\">III-XXXVI. He who remembers a thing, in which he has once taken delight, desires to possess it under the same circumstances</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxxvii/\">III-XXXVII. Desire arising through pain or pleasure, hatred or love, is greater in proportion as the emotion is greater.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxxviii/\">III-XXXVIII. If a man has begun to hate an object of his love, so that love is thoroughly destroyed, he will, causes being equal</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xxix/\">III-XXXIX. He who hates anyone will endeavour to do him an injury, unless he fears that a greater injury will thereby accrue to himself</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xl/\">III-XL. He, who conceives himself to be hated by another, and believes that he has given him no cause for hatred, will hate that other in return.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xli/\">III-XLI.

Hatred is increased by being reciprocated, and can on the other hand be destroyed by love.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xliv/\">III-XLIV. Hatred which is completely vanquished by love passes into love: and love is thereupon greater than if hatred had not preceded it.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xlv/\">III-XLV. If a man conceives, that anyone similar to himself hates anything also similar to himself, which he loves, he will hate that person.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/xlvi/\">III-XLVI.

When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity, it feels pleasure</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/liv/\">III-LIV. The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iii/lv/\">III-LV.

No positive quality possessed by a false idea is removed by the presence of what is true, in virtue of its being true.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/ii/\">IV-II. We are only passive, in so far as we are apart of Nature, which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/iii/\">IV-III. The force whereby a man persists in existing is limited, and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/iv/\">IV-IV. It is impossible, that man should not be a part of Nature, or that he should be capable of undergoing no changes</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/v/\">IV-V. The power and increase of every passion, and its persistence in existing are not defined by the power</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/vi/\">IV-VI. The force of any passion or emotion can overcome the rest of a man’s activities or power, so that the emotion becomes obstinately fixed to him.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/vii/\">IV-VII. An emotion can only be controlled or destroyed by another emotion contrary thereto, and with more power for controlling emotion.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/viii/\">IV-VIII. The knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the emotions of pleasure or pain, in so far as we are conscious thereof.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/ix/\">IV-An emotion, whereof we conceive the cause to be with us at the present time, is stronger than if we did not conceive the cause to be with us.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/x/\">IV-X. Towards something future, which we conceive as close at hand, we are affected more intensely</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xi/\">IV-XI. An emotion towards that which we conceive as necessary is, when other conditions are equal</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xii/\">IV-XII. An emotion towards a thing, which we know not to exist at the present time</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xiii/\">IV-XIII. Emotion towards a thing contingent, which we know not to exist in the present</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xiv/\">IV-XIV. A true knowledge of good and evil cannot check any emotion by virtue of being true, but only in so far as it is considered as an emotion.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xv/\">IV-XV. Desire arising from the knowledge of good and bad can be quenched or checked</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xvi/\">IV-XVI. Desire arising from the knowledge of good and evil, in so far as such knowledge regards what is future</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xvii/\">IV-XVII. Desire arising from the true knowledge of good and evil, in so far as such knowledge is concerned</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xviii/\">IV-XVIII. Desire arising from pleasure is, other conditions being equal, stronger than desire arising from pain.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xix/\">IV-XIX. Every man, by the laws of his nature, necessarily desires or shrinks from that which he deems to be good or bad.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xx/\">IV-XX. The more every man endeavours, and is able to seek what is useful to him—in other words</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxi/\">IV-XXI. No one can desire to be blessed, to act rightly, and to live rightly</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxii/\">IV-XXII. No virtue can be conceived as prior to this endeavour to preserve one’s own being.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxiii/\">IV-XXIII. Man, in so far as he is determined to a particular action because he has inadequate ideas</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxiv/\">IV-XXIV. To act absolutely in obedience to virtue is in us the same thing as to act</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxv/\">IV-XXV. No one wishes to preserve his being for the sake of anything else.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxvi/\">IV-XXVI. Whatsoever we endeavour in obedience to reason is nothing further than to understand</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxvii/\">IV-XXVII. We know nothing to be certainly good or evil, save such things as really conduce to understanding</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxviii/\">IV-XXVIII. The mind’s highest good is the knowledge of God, and the mind’s highest virtue is to know God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxix/\">IV-XXIX. No individual thing, which is entirely different from our own nature</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxx/\">IV-XXX. A thing cannot be bad for us through the quality which it has in common with our nature</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxi/\">IV-XXXI. In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature, it is necessarily good.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxii/\">IV-XXXII. In so far as men are a prey to passion, they cannot, in that respect, be said to be naturally in harmony.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxiii/\">IV-XXXIII. Men can differ in nature, in so far as they are assailed by those emotions, which are passions</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxiv/\">IV-XXXIV. In so far as men are assailed by emotions which are passions, they can be contrary one to another.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxv/\">IV-XXXV. In so far only as men live in obedience to reason, do they always necessarily agree in nature.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxvi/\">IV-XXXVI. The highest good of those who follow virtue is common to all, and therefore all can equally rejoice therein.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxvii/\">IV-XXXVII. The good which every man, who follows after virtue, desires for himself he will also desire for other men</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxviii/\">IV-XXXVIII. Whatsoever disposes the human body, so as to render it capable of being affected in an increased number of ways</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xxxix/\">IV-XXXIX. Whatsoever brings about the preservation of the proportion of motion and rest</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xl/\">IV-XL. Whatsoever conduces to man’s social life, or causes men to live together in harmony, is useful</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xli/\">IV-XLI. Pleasure in itself is not bad but good: contrariwise, pain in itself is bad.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlii/\">IV-XLII. Mirth cannot be excessive, but is always good; contrariwise, Melancholy is always bad.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xliii/\">IV-XLIII. Stimulation may be excessive and bad; on the other hand, grief may be good, in so far as stimulation or pleasure is bad.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xliv/\">IV-XLIV. Love and desire may be excessive.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlv/\">IV-XLV. Hatred can never be good.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlvi/\">IV-XLVI. He, who lives under the guidance of reason, endeavours, as far as possible</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlvii/\">IV-XLVII. Emotions of hope and fear cannot be in themselves good.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlviii/\">IV-XLVIII. The emotions of over—esteem and disparagement are always bad.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/xlix/\">IV-XLIX. Over—esteem is apt to render its object proud.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/l/\">IV-L. Pity, in a man who lives under the guidance of reason, is in itself bad and useless.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/li/\">IV-LI. Approval is not repugnant to reason, but can agree therewith and arise therefrom.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lii/\">IV-LII. Self—approval may arise from reason, and that which arises from reason is the highest possible.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/liii/\">IV-LIII. Humility is not a virtue, or does not arise from reason.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/liv/\">IV-LIV. Repentance is not a virtue, or does not arise from reason; but he who repents of an action is doubly wretched or infirm.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lv/\">IV-LV. Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme ignorance of self.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lvi/\">IV-LVI. Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme infirmity of spirit.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lvii/\">IV-LVII. The proud man delights in the company of flatterers and parasites, but hates the company of the high—minded.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lviii/\">IV-LVIII. Honour (gloria) is not repugnant to reason, but may arise therefrom.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lix/\">IV-LIX. To all the actions, whereto we are determined by emotion wherein the mind is passive</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lx/\">IV-LX. Desire arising from a pleasure or pain, that is not attributable to the whole body</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxi/\">IV-LXI. Desire which springs from reason cannot be excessive.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxii/\">IV-LXII. In so far as the mind conceives a thing under the dictates of reason</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxiii/\">IV-LXIII. He who is led by fear, and does good in order to escape evil, is not led by reason.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxiv/\">IV-LXIV. The knowledge of evil is an inadequate knowledge.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxv/\">IV-LXV. Under the guidance of reason we should pursue the greater of two goods and the lesser of two evils.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxvi/\">IV-LXVI. We may, under the guidance of reason, seek a greater good in the future in preference to a lesser good in the present</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxvii/\">IV-LXVII. A free man thinks of death least of all things; and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxviii/\">IV-LXVIII. If men were born free, they would, so long as they remained free, form no conception of good and evil.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxix/\">IV-LXIX. The virtue of a free man is seen to be as great, when it declines dangers, as when it overcomes them.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxx/\">IV-LXX. The free man, who lives among the ignorant, strives, as far as he can, to avoid receiving favours from them.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxxi/\">IV-LXXI. Only free men are thoroughly grateful one to another.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxxii/\">IV-LXXII. The free man never acts fraudulently, but always in good faith.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/iv/lxxiii/\">IV-LXXIII.

If we remove a disturbance of the spirit, or emotion, from the thought of an external cause</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/iii/\">V-III. An emotion, which is a passion, ceases to be a passion, as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea thereof.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/iv/\">V-IV. There is no modification of the body, whereof we cannot form some clear and distinct conception.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/v/\">V-V. An emotion towards a thing, which we conceive simply</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/vi/\">V-VI. The mind has greater power over the emotions and is less subject thereto, in so far as it understands all things as necessary.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/vii/\">V-VII. Emotions which are aroused or spring from reason, if we take account of time</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/viii/\">V-VIII. An emotion is stronger in proportion to the number of simultaneous concurrent causes whereby it is aroused.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/ix/\">V-</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/x/\">V-X. So long as we are not assailed by emotions contrary to our nature</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xi/\">V-XI. In proportion as a mental image is referred to more objects, so is it more frequent, or more often vivid, and occupies the mind more.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xii/\">V-XII. The mental images of things are more easily associated with the images referred to things</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xiii/\">V-XIII. A mental image is more often vivid, in proportion as it is associated with a greater number of other images.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xiv/\">V-XIV. The mind can bring it about, that all bodily modifications or images of things may be referred to the idea of God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xv/\">V-XV. He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions loves God</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xvi/\">V-XVI. This love towards God must hold the chief place in the mind.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xvii/\">V-XVII. God is without passions, neither is he affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xviii/\">V-XVIII. No one can hate God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xix/\">V-XIX. He, who loves God, cannot endeavour that God should love him in return.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xx/\">V-XX. This love towards God cannot be stained by the emotion of envy or jealousy</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxi/\">V-XXI. The mind can only imagine anything, or remember what is past, while the body endures.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxii/\">V-XXII. Nevertheless in God there is necessarily an idea, which expresses the essence of this or that human body under the form of eternity.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxiii/\">V-XXIII. The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but there remains of it something which is eternal.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxiv/\">V-XXIV. The more we understand particular things, the more do we understand God.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxv/\">V-XXV. The highest endeavour of the mind, and the highest virtue is to understand things by the third kind of knowledge.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxvi/\">V-XXVI. In proportion as the mind is more capable of understanding things by the third kind of knowledge</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxvii/\">V-XXVII. From this third kind of knowledge arises the highest possible mental acquiescence.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxviii/\">V-XXVIII. The endeavour or desire to know things by the third kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first, but from the second kind of knowledge.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxix/\">V-XXIX. Whatsoever the mind understands under the form of eternity</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxx/\">V-XXX. Our mind, in so far as it knows itself and the body under the form of eternity</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxi/\">V-XXXI. The third kind of knowledge depends on the mind, as its formal cause, in so far as the mind itself is eternal.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxii/\">V-XXXII. Whatsoever we understand by the third kind of knowledge, we take delight in, and our delight is accompanied by the idea of God as cause.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxiii/\">V-XXXIII. The intellectual love of God, which arises from the third kind of knowledge, is eternal.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxiv/\">V-XXXIV. The mind is, only while the body endures, subject to those emotions which are attributable to passions.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxv/\">V-XXXV. God loves himself with an infinite intellectual love.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxvi/\">V-XXXVI. The intellectual love of the mind towards God is that very love of God whereby God loves himself</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxvii/\">V-XXXVII. There is nothing in nature, which is contrary to this intellectual love, or which can take it away.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxviii/\">V-XXXVIII. In proportion as the mind understands more things by the second and third kind of knowledge</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xxxix/\">V-XXXIX. He, who possesses a body capable of the greatest number of activities, possesses a mind whereof the greatest part is eternal.</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"/texts/the-ethics/v/xl/\">V-XL.
