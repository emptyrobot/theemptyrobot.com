see a single thing that gives rise to dullness and drowsiness, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like discontent, sloth, yawning, sleepiness after eating, and mental sluggishness.\nWhen you have a sluggish mind, dullness and drowsiness arise, and once arisen they increase and grow.” </p>\n<h2>14</h2>\n<p>“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to restlessness and remorse, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like an unsettled mind.\nWhen you have no peace of mind, restlessness and remorse arise, and once arisen they increase

from arising, or, when they have arisen, gives them up like the elements of initiative, persistence, and vigor.\nWhen you’re energetic, dullness and drowsiness do not arise, or, if they’ve already
