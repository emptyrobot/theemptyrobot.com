For this body is beset with many kinds of affliction, such as the following.\nDiseases of the eye, inner ear, nose, tongue, body, head, outer ear, mouth, teeth, and lips. Cough, asthma, catarrh, inflammation, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gastric pain, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, herpes, itch, scabs, smallpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, piles, pimples, and ulcers. Afflictions stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction. Afflictions caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds. Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.’\nAnd so they meditate observing drawbacks in this body.\nThis is called the perception of drawbacks. </p>\n<p>And what is the perception of giving up?\nIt’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, and they don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.\nThis is called the perception of giving up. </p>\n<p>And what is the perception of fading away?\nIt’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:\n‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, extinguishment.’\nThis is called the perception of fading away. </p>\n<p>And what is the perception of cessation?\nIt’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:\n‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, extinguishment.’\nThis is called the perception of cessation. </p>\n<p>And what is the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world?\nIt’s when a mendicant lives giving up and not grasping on to the attraction and grasping to the world, the mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies.\nThis is called the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world. </p>\n<p>And what is the perception of the impermanence of all conditions?\nIt’s when a mendicant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted with all conditions.\nThis is called the perception of the impermanence of all conditions. </p>\n<p>And what is mindfulness of breathing?\nIt’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.\nJust mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.\nWhen breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’\nWhen breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’\nThey practice breathing in experiencing the whole body.
