Don’t say that, Kokālika!\nHave confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,\nthey’re good monks.” </p>\n<p>For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha,\n“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires.

So what exactly are you doing back here?\nSee how far you have strayed!” </p>\n<p>Then Tudu addressed Kokālika in verse: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A person is born <br>\nwith an axe in their mouth. <br>\nA fool cuts themselves with it <br>\nwhen they say bad words. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you praise someone worthy of criticism, <br>\nor criticize someone worthy of praise, <br>\nyou choose bad luck with your own mouth: <br>\nyou’ll never find happiness that way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, <br>\nif all you lose is your money <br>\nand all you own, even yourself. <br>\nWhat’s really terrible luck <br>\nis to hate the holy ones. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more than two quinquadecillion years, <br>\nand another five quattuordecillion years, <br>\na slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, <br>\nhaving aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.\nHe was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>\n<p>Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,\n“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.\nHe was reborn in the pink lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>\n<p>That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.\nThen he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>\n<p>Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. </p>\n<p>When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,\n“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” </p>\n<p>“It’s long, mendicant.\nIt’s not easy to calculate\nhow many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” </p>\n<p>“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” </p>\n<p>“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. </p>\n<p>“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.\nBy this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.\nNow, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.\nTwenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.\nThe mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.\nThen the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A person is born <br>\nwith an axe in their mouth. <br>\nA fool cuts themselves with it <br>\nwhen they say bad words. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you praise someone worthy of criticism, <br>\nor criticize someone worthy of praise, <br>\nyou choose bad luck with your own mouth: <br>\nyou’ll never find happiness that way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, <br>\nif all you lose is your money <br>\nand all you own, even yourself. <br>\nWhat’s really terrible luck <br>\nis to hate the holy ones. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more than two quinquadecillion years, <br>\nand another five quattuordecillion years, <br>\na slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, <br>\nhaving aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN10/90-khinasavabalasutta/\">AN.10.90.
