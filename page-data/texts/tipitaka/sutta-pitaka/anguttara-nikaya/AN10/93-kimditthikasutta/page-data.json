Afterwards it won’t be hard for me to explain my views.” </p>\n<p>When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him,\n“The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.\nThat’s my view, householder.” </p>\n<p>Another wanderer said,\n“The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.\nThat’s my view, householder.” </p>\n<p>Another wanderer said,\n“The world is finite …” …\n“The world is infinite …” …\n“The soul and the body are the same thing …” …\n“The soul and the body are different things …” …\n“A Realized One exists after death …” …\n“A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …” …\n“A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …” …\n“A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.
