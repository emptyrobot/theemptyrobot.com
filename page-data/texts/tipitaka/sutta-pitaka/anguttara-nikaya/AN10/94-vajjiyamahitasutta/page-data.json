The wanderers said to him: </p>\n<p>“Is it really true, householder? Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification? Does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough?” </p>\n<p>“No, sirs, the ascetic Gotama does not criticize all forms of mortification. Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough.\nThe Buddha criticizes where it is due, and praises where it is due.\nIn doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the question,\nand is not definitive on this point.” </p>\n<p>When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him,\n“Hold on, householder! That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statements.” </p>\n<p>“On this point, also, I reasonably respond to the venerables.\nThe Buddha has stated ‘This is skillful’ and\n‘This is unskillful’.\nSo when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statement.\nHe is not an exterminator who refrains from making statements.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.\nSeeing this, Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,\nand informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. </p>\n<p>“Good, good, householder!\nThat’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time.\nHouseholder, I don’t say that all mortifications should be undergone.\nBut I don’t say that no mortifications should be undergone.\nI don’t say that all observances should be undertaken.\nBut I don’t say that no observances should be undertaken.\nI don’t say that all efforts should be tried.\nBut I don’t say that no efforts should be tried.\nI don’t say that everything should be given up.\nBut I don’t say that nothing should be given up.\nI don’t say that you should be liberated with all kinds of freedom.\nBut I don’t say that you should not be liberated with any kind of freedom. </p>\n<p>When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.
