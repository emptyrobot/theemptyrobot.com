They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. </p>\n<p>They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. </p>\n<p>They give up unchastity.

They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. </p>\n<p>They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other.

Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.\nWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. </p>\n<p>When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.\nIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.
