He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: </p>\n<p>“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?” </p>\n<p>“There is, householder.” </p>\n<p>“And what is that one thing?” </p>\n<p>“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nThen they reflect:\n‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’\nThey understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’\nAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.\nIf they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.\nThis is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …\nthird absorption …\nfourth absorption.\nThen they reflect:\n‘Even this fourth absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’\nThey understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’\nAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.\nIf they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation.

In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.\nThen they reflect:\n‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’\nThey understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’\nAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.\nIf they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation.

They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.\nThis too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One … </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.\nThen they reflect:\n‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’\nThey understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’\nAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.\nIf they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.\nThis too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One … </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …\nGoing totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …\nThen they reflect:\n‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’\nThey understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’\nAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.\nIf they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation.

And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!\nIn the same way, I was searching for the door to the deathless.
