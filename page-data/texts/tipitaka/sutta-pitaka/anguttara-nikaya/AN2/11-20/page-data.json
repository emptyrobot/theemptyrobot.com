speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’\nReflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.\nThis is called the power of reflection. </p>\n<p>And what, mendicants, is the power of development?\nIn this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees.\nFor when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.\nThen you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.\nThis is called the power of development.\nThese are the two powers.” </p>\n<h2>12</h2>\n<p>“There are, mendicants, these two powers.\nWhat two?\nThe power of reflection and the power of development.\nAnd what, mendicants, is the

keeping themselves pure.\nThis is called the power of reflection. </p>\n<p>And what, mendicants, is the power of development?\nIt’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nAnd with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’\nGiving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.\nThis is called the power of development.\nThese are the two powers.” </p>\n<h2>14</h2>\n<p>“There are, mendicants, these two ways of teaching the Dhamma.\nWhat two?\nIn brief and in detail.\nThese are two ways of teaching the Dhamma.” </p>\n<h2>15</h2>\n<p>“Mendicants, in a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect that issue\nwill lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably.\nBut in a disciplinary issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue\nwon’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably. </p>\n<p>And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully check themselves?\nAn offending mendicant reflects:\n‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body.\nThat mendicant saw me do this.\nIf I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t have seen me.\nBut since I did commit that offense, they did see me.\nWhen they saw me, they were upset,\nand they voiced their unhappiness to me.\nThen I also got upset,\nso I told others.\nSo the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their goods.’\nThat’s how, mendicants, an offending mendicant carefully checks themselves. </p>\n<p>And how, mendicants, does an accusing mendicant carefully check themselves?\nAn accusing mendicant reflects:\n‘This mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense with the body.\nI saw them do that.\nIf they hadn’t committed that offense, I wouldn’t have seen them.\nBut since they did commit that offense, I did see them.\nWhen I saw them, I was upset,\nand I voiced my unhappiness to them.\nThen they also got upset,\nso they told others.\nSo the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on

brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.\nWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>\n<p>“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?” </p>\n<p>“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” </p>\n<p>“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” </p>\n<p>“Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>\n<p>“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!\nAs if he was righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.\nI go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.\nFrom this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>\n<h2>17</h2>\n<p>Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.\nWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>\n<p>“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?” </p>\n<p>“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done.\nThat’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” </p>\n<p>“But what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” </p>\n<p>“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done.\nThat’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>\n<p>“I don’t understand the meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief, without explaining the details.\nMaster Gotama, please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Firstly, brahmin, someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body, speech, and mind.\nSo what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\nFurthermore, brahmin, someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.\nSo what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>\n<p>“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>\n<h2>18</h2>\n<p>Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,\n“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should not do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.” </p>\n<p>“But, sir, if someone does these things that should not be done, what drawbacks should they expect?” </p>\n<p>“They should expect these drawbacks.\nThey blame themselves.\nAfter examination, sensible people criticize them.\nThey get a bad reputation.\nThey feel lost when they die.\nAnd when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\nThese are the drawbacks they should expect.” </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.” </p>\n<p>“But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what benefits should they expect?” </p>\n<p>“They should expect these benefits.\nThey don’t blame themselves.\nAfter examination, sensible people praise them.\nThey get a good reputation.\nThey don’t feel lost when they die.\nAnd when the body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.\nThese are the benefits they should expect.” </p>\n<h2>19</h2>\n<p>“Mendicants, give up the unskillful.\nIt is possible to give up the unskillful.\nIf it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say:\n‘Give up the unskillful.’\nBut it is possible, and so I say:\n‘Give up the unskillful.’\nAnd if giving up the unskillful led to harm and suffering, I would not say:\n‘Give up the unskillful.’\nBut giving up the unskillful leads to welfare and happiness, so I say:\n‘Give up the unskillful.’ </p>\n<p>Mendicants, develop the skillful.\nIt is possible to develop the skillful.\nIf it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say:\n‘Develop the skillful.’\nBut it is possible, and so I say:\n‘Develop the skillful.’\nIf developing the skillful led to harm and suffering I wouldn’t say:\n‘Develop the skillful.’\nBut developing the skillful leads to welfare and happiness, so I say:\n‘Develop the skillful.’” </p>\n<h2>20</h2>\n<p>“These two things, mendicants, lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.\nWhat two?\nThe words and phrases are misplaced, and the meaning is misinterpreted.\nWhen the words and phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted.\nThese two things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. </p>\n<p>These two things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.\nWhat two?\nThe words and phrases are well organized, and the meaning is correctly interpreted.\nWhen the words and phrases are well organized, the meaning is correctly interpreted.\nThese two things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN2/21-31/\">AN.2.21–31</a></p>\n</div>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"11"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“There are, mendicants, these two powers.\nWhat two?\nThe power of reflection and the power of development.\nAnd what, mendicants, is the power of reflection?\nIt’s when someone reflects:\n‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’\nReflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.\nThis is called the power of reflection.
