It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.\nThat bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods:\n‘Mister, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I saw nothing, sir.’\nThen King Yama says,\n‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I saw that, sir.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama says,\n‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—\n“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama says,\n‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.\nWell, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.\nThat bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.\nThat bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods:\n‘Mister, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I saw nothing, sir.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama says,\n‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I saw that, sir.’ </p>\n<p>Then King Yama says,\n‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—\n“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ </p>\n<p>They say,\n‘I couldn’t, sir.

It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.\nThat bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>\n<p>Then, after grilling them about the third messenger of the gods, King Yama falls silent.\nThen the wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.\nThey drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.\nAnd there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated. </p>\n<p>Then the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. … </p>\n<p>They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. … </p>\n<p>They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. … </p>\n<p>They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. … </p>\n<p>Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.\nThere they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.\nAnd there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\nThen the wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell. </p>\n<p>Now, about that Great Hell: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Four are its corners, four its doors, <br>\nneatly divided in equal parts. <br>\nSurrounded by an iron wall, <br>\nof iron is its roof. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ground is even made of iron, <br>\nit burns with fierce fire. <br>\nThe heat forever radiates <br>\na hundred leagues around.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once upon a time, King Yama thought,\n‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments.\nOh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha!\nThen the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’ </p>\n<p>Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those people who are negligent, <br>\nwhen warned by the gods’ messengers: <br>\na long time they sorrow, <br>\nwhen they go to that wretched place. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But those good and peaceful people, <br>\nwhen warned by the god’s messengers, <br>\nnever neglect <br>\nthe teaching of the noble ones. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seeing the peril in grasping, <br>\nthe origin of birth and death, <br>\nthey’re freed by not grasping, <br>\nwith the ending of birth and death. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Happy, they’ve come to a safe place, <br>\nextinguished in this very life. <br>\nThey’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, <br>\nand risen above all suffering.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN3/37-catumaharajasutta/\">AN.3.37.
