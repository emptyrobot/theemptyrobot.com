And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.\nIt’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>\n<p>Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura said to the Buddha: </p>\n<p>“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,\nhow your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright.\nIt’s like a golden brown jujube in the autumn,\nor a palm fruit freshly plucked from the stalk,\nor a pendant of river gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well wrought in the forge, and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates.\nIn the same way, your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright. </p>\n<p>Surely Master Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as:\nsofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, double-or single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots, antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends.” </p>\n<p>“Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding\nare hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re not allowed. </p>\n<p>There are, brahmin, these three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.\nWhat three?\nThe high and luxurious beds of the gods, of Brahmā, and of the noble ones.\nThese are the three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.” </p>\n<p>“But what, Master Gotama, is the high and luxurious bed of the gods?” </p>\n<p>“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms.\nAfter the meal, on my return from alms-round, I enter a wood.\nI gather up some grass or leaves into a pile, and sit down cross-legged, with my body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.\nQuite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nAnd with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’\nWith the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.\nWhen I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time I walk like the gods.\nWhen I’m practicing like this, if I stand, at that time I stand like the gods.\nWhen I’m practicing like this, if I sit, at that time I sit like the gods.\nWhen I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time I lie down like the gods.\nThis is the high and luxurious bed of the gods that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.” </p>\n<p>“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing!\nWho but Master Gotama could get such a high and luxurious bed of the gods when he wants, without trouble or difficulty? </p>\n<p>But what, Master Gotama, is the high and luxurious bed of Brahmā?” </p>\n<p>“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms.\nAfter the meal, on my return from alms-round, I enter a wood.\nI gather up some grass or leaves into a pile, and sit down cross-legged, with my body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.\nI meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.
