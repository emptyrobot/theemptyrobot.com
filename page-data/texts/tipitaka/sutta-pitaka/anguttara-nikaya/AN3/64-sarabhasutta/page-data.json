He sat on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderer Sarabha,\n“Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve been saying:\n‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,\nthen I left their teaching and training.’”\nWhen he said this, Sarabha kept silent. </p>\n<p>For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,\n“Tell me, Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?\nIf you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.\nBut if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”\nFor a second time, Sarabha kept silent. </p>\n<p>For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,\n“Sarabha, the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me. What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?\nIf you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.\nBut if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”\nFor a third time, Sarabha kept silent. </p>\n<p>Then those wanderers said to Sarabha,\n“The ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask for.\nSpeak, reverend Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?\nIf you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in.\nBut if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.”\nWhen this was said, Sarabha sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>\n<p>Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers: </p>\n<p>“Wanderers, someone might say to me:\n‘You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha, but regarding these things you’re not fully awakened.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.\nWhen grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha. </p>\n<p>Wanderers, someone might say to me:\n‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.\nWhen grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories.
