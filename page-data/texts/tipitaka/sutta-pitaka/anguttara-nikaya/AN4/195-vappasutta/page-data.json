Mahāmoggallāna said to him: </p>\n<p>“Vappa, take a person who is restrained in body, speech, and mind. When ignorance fades away and knowledge arises,\ndo you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, I do see such a case.\nTake a person who did bad deeds in a past life. But the result of that has not yet ripened.\nFor this reason defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life.”\nBut this conversation between Mahāmoggallāna and Vappa was left unfinished. </p>\n<p>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Mahāmoggallāna, </p>\n<p>“Moggallāna, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?” </p>\n<p>Moggallāna repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha, and concluded:\n“This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha said to Vappa,\n“Vappa, we can discuss this.

What’s the meaning of that?’” </p>\n<p>“Sir, let us discuss this.
