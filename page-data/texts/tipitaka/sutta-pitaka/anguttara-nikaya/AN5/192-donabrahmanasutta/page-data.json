I recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth.

They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it.

We just know the word ‘brahmin’.\nMaster Gotama, please teach me this matter so I can learn about these five brahmins.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes sir,” Doṇa replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Doṇa, how is a brahmin equal to Brahmā? </p>\n<p>It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, incontestable and irreproachable in discussions about ancestry.\nFor forty-eight years he leads the virginal spiritual life studying the hymns.\nThen he seeks a fee for his teacher, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. </p>\n<p>In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate?\nNot by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, but solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl.\nHaving offered the fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.\nThey meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …\nrejoicing …\nequanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.\nHaving developed these four Brahmā meditations, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm. </p>\n<p>That’s how a brahmin is equal to Brahmā. </p>\n<p>And how is a brahmin equal to a god? </p>\n<p>It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides …\nHaving offered the fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. </p>\n<p>In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate?\nNot by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water.\nHe has sex only with a brahmin woman. He does not have sex with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, merchants, workers, outcastes, hunters, bamboo workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. Nor does he have sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation. </p>\n<p>And why does the brahmin not have sex with a pregnant woman?\nIf a brahmin had sex with a pregnant woman, the boy or girl would be born in too much filth.\nThat’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a pregnant woman. </p>\n<p>And why does the brahmin not have sex with a breastfeeding woman?\nIf a brahmin had sex with a breastfeeding woman, the boy or girl would drink back the semen.\nThat’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a breastfeeding woman. </p>\n<p>And why does the brahmin not have sex outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation? Because his brahmin wife is not there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, but only for procreation.\nHaving ensured his progeny through sex, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>When he has gone forth, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.\nHaving developed these four absorptions, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>\n<p>That’s how a brahmin is equal to god. </p>\n<p>And how does a brahmin toe the line? </p>\n<p>It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … </p>\n<p> Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water.\nHaving ensured his progeny through sex, his child makes him happy. Because of this attachment he stays in his family property, and does not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he doesn’t cross over it.\nThat’s why he’s called a brahmin who toes the line. </p>\n<p>That’s how a brahmin toes the line. </p>\n<p>And how does a brahmin cross the line? </p>\n<p>It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … </p>\n<p>  Having offered a fee for his teacher, he seeks a wife by both legitimate and illegitimate means.
