Hopefully when he hears Nārada’s teaching, the king could give up sorrow’s arrow.” </p>\n<p>Then Piyaka went to the king and said to him,\n“Sire, this Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta.\nHe has this good reputation:\n‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’\nWhat if Your Majesty was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada?

He went to Nārada, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, </p>\n<p>“Sir, King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away.\nAnd since she passed away, the king has not bathed, anointed himself, eaten his meals, or got his business done.\nDay and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.\nSir, please teach the king so that, when he hears your teaching, he can give up sorrow’s arrow.” </p>\n<p>“Please, Piyaka, let the king come when he likes.” </p>\n<p>Then Piyaka got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Venerable Nārada, keeping him on his right, before going to the king and saying,\n“Sire, the request for an audience with Venerable Nārada has been granted.\nPlease, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, my good Piyaka, harness the finest chariots.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer.
