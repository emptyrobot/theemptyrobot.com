Your body feels like it’s drugged. You’re disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill your mind.

He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”\nAnd that mendicant became one of the perfected. </p>\n<p>When that mendicant had attained perfection, he went up to his own mentor, and said,\n“Now, sir, my body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged.
