I am unable to keep up the spiritual life.\nI declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.”’\nBut while traveling on the road, before he reaches the monastery he declares his inability to continue training. He rejects it and returns to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>I say that this person is like the warrior who is taken to his relatives for care, but he dies on the road before he reaches them. Some people are like that.\nThis is the second person similar to a warrior found among the monks. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant lives supported by a town or village.\nHe robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.\nThere he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.\nLust infects his mind,\nand his body and mind burn with it.\nHe thinks:\n‘Why don’t I go to the monastery and tell the monks: </p>\n<p>“Reverends, I am overcome with lust, mired in lust.

I am unable to keep up the spiritual life.\nI declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.’ </p>\n<p>His spiritual companions advise and instruct him:\n‘Reverend, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.\nWith the similes of a skeleton …\na lump of meat …\na grass torch …\na pit of glowing coals …\na dream …\nborrowed goods …\nfruit on a tree …\na butcher’s knife and chopping block …\na staking sword …\na snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.\nBe happy with the spiritual life.\nVenerable, please don’t declare your inability to continue training, reject it and return to a lesser life.’ </p>\n<p>When thus advised and instructed by his spiritual companions, he says:\n‘Reverends, even though the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks,\nI am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.’\nDeclaring his inability to continue training, he rejects it and returns to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>I say that this person is like the warrior who dies of his injuries while in the care of his relatives. Some people are like that.\nThis is the third person similar to a warrior found among the monks. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant lives supported by a town or village.\nHe robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.\nThere he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.\nLust infects his mind,\nand his body and mind burn with it.\nHe thinks:\n‘Why don’t I go to the monastery and tell the monks: </p>\n<p>“Reverends, I am overcome with lust, mired in lust.

For this reason, he practices restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.\nHearing a sound with his ears …\nSmelling an odor with his nose …\nTasting a flavor with his tongue …\nFeeling a touch with his body …\nKnowing a thought with his mind, he doesn’t get caught up in the features and details.\nIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, he practices restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.\nThen after the meal, on his return from alms-round,\nhe frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.\nGone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, with his body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.\nHe gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.\nThen, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. </p>\n<p>When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.\nHe truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. He truly understands: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When freed, he knows ‘it is freed’.\nHe understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>\n<p>I say that this person is like the warrior who dons his sword and shield, fastens his bow and arrows, and plunges into the thick of battle. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle.\nSome people are like that.\nThis is the fifth person similar to a warrior found among the monks. </p>\n<p>These five people similar to warriors are found among the monks.” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN5/77-pathamaanagatabhayasutta/\">AN.5.77.
