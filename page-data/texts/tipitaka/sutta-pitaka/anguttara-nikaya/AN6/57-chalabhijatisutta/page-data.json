And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense. </p>\n<p>I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth.\nListen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth?\nSomeone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.\nSomeone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.\nSomeone born into a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.\nSomeone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.\nSomeone born into a bright class gives rise to a bright result.\nSomeone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. </p>\n<p>And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result?\nIt’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.\nAnd they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.\nAnd they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.\nWhen their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\nThat’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result. </p>\n<p>And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright result?\nIt’s when some person is reborn in a low family …\nBut they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.\nWhen their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.\nThat’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result. </p>\n<p>And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright?\nIt’s when some person is reborn in a low family …\nThey shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.\nThey give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
