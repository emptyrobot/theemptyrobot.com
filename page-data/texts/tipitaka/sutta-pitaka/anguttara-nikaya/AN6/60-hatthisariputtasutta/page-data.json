Wait until the end of the discussion.” </p>\n<p>When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions said to Mahākoṭṭhita,\n“Venerable, please don’t rebuke Citta Hatthisāriputta. He is astute,\nand quite capable of talking about the teachings with the senior mendicants.” </p>\n<p>“It’s not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don’t comprehend another’s mind. </p>\n<p>Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most unruffled of the unruffled, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role.\nBut when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers.\nAs they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen.\nWould it be right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?” </p>\n<p>“No it would not, reverend.\nFor it’s quite possible that that ox will snap the ropes or break out of the pen, and then invade the crops.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet …\nAs they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.\nThinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Suppose it was raining heavily at the crossroads so that the dust vanished and mud appeared.\nWould it be right to say that now dust will never appear at this crossroad again?” </p>\n<p>“No it would not, reverend.\nFor it is quite possible that people or cattle and so on will cross over the crossroad, or that the wind and sun will evaporate the moisture so that the dust appears again.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.\nThinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Take another case of a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption.\nThinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Suppose there was a large pond not far from a town or village.\nAfter it rained heavily there the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel would vanish.\nWould it be right to say that now the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel will never appear here again?” </p>\n<p>“No it would not, reverend.\nFor it’s quite possible that people or cattle and so on will drink from the pond, or that the wind and sun will evaporate it so that the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel appear again.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, take another case of a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption.\nThinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Take the case of another person who, with the fading away of rapture … enters and remains in the third absorption.\nThinking, ‘I get the third absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …\nThey resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>\n<p>Suppose a person had finished a delicious meal.

He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”\nAnd Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN6/61-majjhesutta/\">AN.6.61.
