What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?”\nWhen this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,\nfor craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“Identity, reverends, is one end. The origin of identity is the second end. The cessation of identity is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,\nfor craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.\nThat’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>\n<p>“Each of us has spoken from the heart.\nCome, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this.\nAs he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied.\nThen those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,\nand informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked,\n“Sir, who has spoken well?” </p>\n<p>“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way.
