Now is the time, Holy One!\nLet the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present.\nNevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from that the skillful will appear.\nSo this person is not liable to decline in the future.’\nSuppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field.\nWouldn’t you know that those seeds would grow, increase, and mature?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …\nThis person is not liable to decline in the future …\nThis is how another individual is known to the Realized One by comprehending their mind.\nAnd this is how the Realized One knows a person’s faculties by comprehending their mind.\nAnd this is how the Realized One knows the future origination of a person’s qualities by comprehending their mind. </p>\n<p>When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘The unskillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still present.\nNevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, and from that the unskillful will appear.\nSo this person is still liable to decline in the future.’\nSuppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And they were sown on a broad rock.\nWouldn’t you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and mature?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …\nThis person is still liable to decline in the future …\nThis is how another individual is known to the Realized One … </p>\n<p>When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’\nSuppose some seeds were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged.

They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ …” </p>\n<p>When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,\n“Sir, can you describe three other persons who are counterparts of these three?” </p>\n<p>“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha.\n“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present.\nNevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed.\nSo this person is still liable to decline in the future.’\nSuppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. And they were placed on a broad rock.\nWouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Or suppose it was the late afternoon and the sun was going down. Wouldn’t you know that the light was about to vanish and darkness appear?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midnight meal. Wouldn’t you know that the light had vanished and the darkness appeared?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …\nThis person is still liable to decline in the future … </p>\n<p>When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘The unskillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still present.\nNevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed.\nSo this person is not liable to decline in the future.’\nSuppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber.\nWouldn’t you know that those coals would grow, increase, and spread?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Suppose it’s the crack of dawn and the sun is rising. Wouldn’t you know that the dark will vanish and the light appear?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midday meal. Wouldn’t you know that the dark had vanished and the light appeared?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …\nThis person is not liable to decline in the future … </p>\n<p>When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:\n‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’\nAfter some time I comprehend their mind and understand:\n‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities. They have exclusively bright, blameless qualities. They will become extinguished in this very life.’\nSuppose that there were some cool, extinguished coals. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber.\nWouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …\n‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities.
