And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said,\nbut why did I say it?\nThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.\nSights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.\nSounds known by the ear …\nSmells known by the nose …\nTastes known by the tongue …\nTouches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.\nHowever, these are not sensual pleasures. In the training of the Noble One they’re called ‘kinds of sensual stimulation’. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. <br>\nThe world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures. <br>\nGreedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. <br>\nThe world’s pretty things stay just as they are, <br>\nbut a wise one removes desire for them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And what is the source of sensual pleasures? </p>\n<p>Contact is their source. </p>\n<p>And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures?\nThe sensual desire for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different.\nThis is called the diversity of sensual pleasures. </p>\n<p>And what is the result of sensual pleasures?\nWhen one who desires sensual pleasures creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of sensual pleasures. </p>\n<p>And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures?\nWhen contact ceases, sensual pleasures cease.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way—and understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation—they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures.\n‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’\nThat’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>\n<p>‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’\nThat’s what I said, but why did I say it?\nThere are these three feelings:\npleasant, painful, and neutral. </p>\n<p>And what is the source of feelings?\nContact is their source. </p>\n<p>And what is the diversity of feelings?\nThere are material pleasant feelings, spiritual pleasant feelings, material painful feelings, spiritual painful feelings, material neutral feelings, and spiritual neutral feelings.\nThis is called the diversity of feelings. </p>\n<p>And what is the result of feelings?\nWhen one who feels creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—\nthis is called the result of feelings. </p>\n<p>And what is the cessation of feelings?\nWhen contact ceases, feelings cease.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>When a noble disciple understands feelings in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of feelings.\n‘Feelings should be known.

And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’\nThat’s what I said, but why did I say it?\nThere are these six perceptions:\nperceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. </p>\n<p>And what is the source of perceptions?\nContact is their source. </p>\n<p>And what is the diversity of perceptions?\nThe perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts are all different.\nThis is called the diversity of perceptions. </p>\n<p>And what is the result of perceptions?\nCommunication is the result of perception, I say.\nYou communicate something in whatever manner you perceive it, saying ‘That’s what I perceived.’\nThis is called the result of perceptions. </p>\n<p>And what is the cessation of perception?\nWhen contact ceases, perception ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>When a noble disciple understands perception in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of perception.\n‘Perceptions should be known.

And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’\nThat’s what I said, but why did I say it?\nThere are these three defilements:\nthe defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. </p>\n<p>And what is the source of defilements?\nIgnorance is the source of defilements. </p>\n<p>And what is the diversity of defilements?\nThere are defilements that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods.\nThis is called the diversity of defilements. </p>\n<p>And what is the result of defilements?\nWhen one who is ignorant creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of defilements. </p>\n<p>And what is the cessation of defilements?\nWhen ignorance ceases, defilements cease.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of defilements is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>When a noble disciple understands defilements in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of defilements.\n‘Defilements should be known.

And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’\nThat’s what I said, but why did I say it?\nRebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. </p>\n<p>And what is the source of suffering?\nCraving is the source of suffering. </p>\n<p>And what is the diversity of suffering?\nThere is suffering that is severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade.\nThis is called the diversity of suffering. </p>\n<p>And what is the result of suffering?\nIt’s when someone who is overcome and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and wails and laments, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that suffering, they begin an external search, wondering:\n‘Who knows one or two phrases to stop this suffering?’\nThe result of suffering is either confusion or a search, I say.\nThis is called the result of suffering. </p>\n<p>And what is the cessation of suffering?\nWhen craving ceases, suffering ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>When a noble disciple understands suffering in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of suffering.\n‘Suffering should be known.
