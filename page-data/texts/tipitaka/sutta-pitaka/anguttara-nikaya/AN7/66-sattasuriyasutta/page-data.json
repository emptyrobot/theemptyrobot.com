It sinks 84,000 leagues below the ocean and rises 84,000 leagues above it.\nThere comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the rain doesn’t fall. For many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years no rain falls.\nWhen this happens, the plants and seeds, the herbs, grass, and big trees wither away and dry up, and are no more.\nSo impermanent are conditions,\nso unstable, so unreliable.\nThis is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a second sun appears.\nWhen this happens, the streams and pools wither away and dry up, and are no more.\nSo impermanent are conditions … </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a third sun appears.\nWhen this happens, the great rivers—\nthe Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—wither away and dry up, and are no more.\nSo impermanent are conditions … </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fourth sun appears.\nWhen this happens, the great lakes from which the rivers originate—\nthe Anotattā, Sīhapapātā, Rathakārā, Kaṇṇamuṇḍā, Kuṇālā, Chaddantā, and Mandākinī—wither away and dry up, and are no more.\nSo impermanent are conditions … </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fifth sun appears.\nWhen this happens, the water in the ocean sinks by a hundred leagues. It sinks by two, three, four, five, six, or even seven hundred leagues.\nThe water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm trees deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, or even one palm tree deep.\nThe water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, one or even half a fathom deep. It’s waist high, knee high, or even ankle high.\nIt’s like the time in the autumn, when the rain falls heavily and water remains here and there in the cows’ hoofprints.\nIn the same way, water in the ocean remains here and there in puddles like cows’ hoofprints.\nWhen the fifth sun appears there’s not even enough water in the great ocean to wet a toe-joint.\nSo impermanent are conditions … </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a sixth sun appears.\nWhen this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes.\nIt’s like when a potter’s kiln is first kindled, and it smokes and smolders and gives off fumes.\nIn the same way, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes.\nSo impermanent are conditions … </p>\n<p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a seventh sun appears.\nWhen this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in one burning mass of fire.\nAnd as they blaze and burn the flames are swept by the wind as far as the Brahmā realm.\nSineru the king of mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it’s overcome by the great fire. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or two, three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn.\nAnd when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.\nIt’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.\nIn the same way, when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.\nSo impermanent are conditions,\nso unstable are conditions,\nso unreliable are conditions.\nThis is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>\n<p>Mendicants, who would ever think or believe that\nthis earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth? </p>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.\nHe had many hundreds of disciples.\nHe taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.\nThose who totally understood Sunetta’s teachings were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, the company of Brahmā.\nOf those who didn’t totally understand Sunetta’s teachings, some—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create, some with the Joyful Gods, some with the Gods of Yama, some with the Gods of the Thirty-Three, and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Some were reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders. </p>\n<p>Then the teacher Sunetta thought:\n‘It’s not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don’t I further develop love?’ </p>\n<p>Then Sunetta developed love for seven years.\nHaving done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction.\nAs the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance.\nAs it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā.\nThere he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.\nHe was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times.\nMany hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.\nHe had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.\nAfter conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.\nYet even though Sunetta lived so long, he was not exempt from\nrebirth, old age, and death. He was not exempt from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, I say. </p>\n<p>Why is that?\nBecause of not understanding and not penetrating four things.\nWhat four?\nNoble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.\nThese noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” </p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.\nThen the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom, <br>\nand the supreme freedom: <br>\nthese things have been understood <br>\nby Gotama the renowned. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And so the Buddha, having insight, <br>\nexplained this teaching to the mendicants. <br>\nThe Teacher has made an end of suffering; <br>\nseeing clearly, he is extinguished.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/anguttara-nikaya/AN7/67-nagaropamasutta/\">AN.7.67.
