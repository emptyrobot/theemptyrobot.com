The mendicant said to him: </p>\n<p>“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and incredible qualities.\nWhat are the eight qualities that he spoke of?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, I don’t know\nwhat eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to.\nBut these eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me.\nListen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, householder,” replied the mendicant.\nUgga of Hatthi said this: </p>\n<p>“Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance I was partying in the Dragon’s Park.\nMy heart was inspired as soon as I saw him, and I sobered up.\nThis is the first incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha.\nThe Buddha taught me step by step, with\na talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven.\nHe explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.\nAnd when he knew that my mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:\nsuffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.\nJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,\nin that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in me:\n‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’\nI saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. Right there I went for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth.\nThis is the second incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>I had four teenage wives.\nAnd I went to them and said:\n‘Sisters, I’ve undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth.\nIf you wish, you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return to your own families.\nOr would you prefer if I gave you to another man?’\nWhen I said this, my eldest wife said to me:\n‘Master, please give me to such-and-such a man.’\nThen I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that man with the pouring of water.\nBut I can’t recall getting upset while giving away my teenage wife.\nThis is the third incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>And though my family has wealth,\nit’s shared without reserve with ethical people of good character.\nThis is the fourth incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>When I pay homage to a mendicant,\nI do so carefully, not carelessly.\nIf that venerable teaches me the Dhamma,\nI listen carefully, not carelessly.\nBut if they don’t teach me the Dhamma, I teach them.\nThis is the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>It’s not unusual for deities to come to me when the Saṅgha has been invited and announce:\n‘Householder, that mendicant is freed both ways.

That one is ethical, of good character. That one is unethical, of bad character.’\nBut while I’m serving the Saṅgha I don’t recall thinking:\n‘Let me give this one just a little, and that one a lot.’\nRather, I give impartially.\nThis is the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>It’s not unusual for deities to come to me and announce:\n‘Householder, the Buddha’s teaching is well explained!’\nWhen they say this I say to them:\n‘The Buddha’s teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or not you deities say so!’\nBut I don’t recall getting too excited by the fact that\nthe deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.\nThis is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me:\n‘The householder Ugga of Hatthi is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’\nThis is the eighth incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>\n<p>These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me.\nBut I don’t know\nwhat eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to.” </p>\n<p>Then that mendicant, after taking alms-food in Ugga of Hatthi’s home, got up from his seat and left.\nThen after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.\nHe informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga of the village of Hatthi.
