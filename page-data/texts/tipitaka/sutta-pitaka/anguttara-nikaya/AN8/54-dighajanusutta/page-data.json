We use sandalwood imported from Kāsi, we wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and we accept gold and money.\nMay the Buddha please teach us the Dhamma in a way that leads to our welfare and happiness in this life and in future lives.” </p>\n<p>“Byagghapajja, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in this life.\nWhat four? </p>\n<p>Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances.\nAnd what is accomplishment in initiative?\nIt’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as\nfarming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.\nHe understands how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work.\nThis is called accomplishment in initiative. </p>\n<p>And what is accomplishment in protection?\nIt’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.\nHe ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking:\n‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’\nThis is called accomplishment in protection. </p>\n<p>And what is accomplishment in good friendship?\nIt’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.\nThis is called accomplishment in good friendship. </p>\n<p>And what is accomplishment in balanced finances?\nIt’s when a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal.
