He went to Sāriputta and said to him,\n“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied. </p>\n<p>Now at that time the venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying:\n“Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables!\nNow Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion’s roar in the presence of the Buddha!” </p>\n<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>\n<p>“Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this complaint:\n‘Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.’” </p>\n<p>“Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>\n<p>Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.\nIn the same way, I live with a heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.\nSomeone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>\n<p>Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in water, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood.

They’d enter with a humble mind.\nIn the same way, I live with a heart like an outcaste boy or girl, abundant, limitless, measureless, free of enmity and ill will.\nSomeone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>\n<p>Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well trained.
