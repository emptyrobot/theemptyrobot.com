Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?” </p>\n<p>“Enough, brahmins.\nLeave this aside:\n‘These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?’\nI will teach you the Dhamma.\nListen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes sir,” those brahmins replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Suppose there were four men standing in the four directions.
