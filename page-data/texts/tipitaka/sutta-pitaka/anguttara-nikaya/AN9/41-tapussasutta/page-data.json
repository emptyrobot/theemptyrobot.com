We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them.\nBut renunciation seems like an abyss.\nI have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are eager for renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful.\nRenunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.” </p>\n<p>“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter.\nCome, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.\nAs he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa.\nThen Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened. </p>\n<p>“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!\nBefore my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,\n‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’\nBut my mind wasn’t eager for renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.\nThen I thought,\n‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’\nThen I thought,\n‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that.
