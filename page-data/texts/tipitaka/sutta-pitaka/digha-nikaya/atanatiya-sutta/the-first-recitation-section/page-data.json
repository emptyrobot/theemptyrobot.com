At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then, late at night, the Four Great Kings—with large armies of spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—set guards, troops, and wards at the four quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak with their beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.</p>\n<p>Seated to one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the Buddha, “Sir, some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. But mostly the spirits don’t have confidence in the Buddha. Why is that? Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and drinking alcohol. But mostly they don’t refrain from such things. They don’t like that or approve of it.</p>\n<p>Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat. There dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddha’s dispensation. To give them confidence, may the Buddha please learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.” The Buddha consented in silence.</p>\n<p>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, on that occasion Great King Vessavaṇa recited the Āṭānāṭiya protection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hail Vipassī, <br>\nthe glorious seer!

<br>\nWe bow to Gotama the awakened!’ <br>\n<br>\nWhere lovely Uttarakuru is, <br>\nand the beautiful Mount Meru, <br>\nhumans born there <br>\nare unselfish, not possessive. <br>\n<br>\nThey do not sow the seed, <br>\nnor do they draw the plough. <br>\nThe rice eaten by people <br>\nripens in untilled soil, <br>\n<br>\nfree of powder or husk, pure, <br>\nfragrant, with only the rice-grain. <br>\nThey eat that food <br>\nafter cooking it in a ‘parrot’s beak’. <br>\n<br>\nHaving prepared a cow with hooves uncloven, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\nHaving prepared a beast with hooves uncloven, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\n<br>\nHaving prepared a woman-drawn carriage, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\nHaving prepared a man-drawn carriage, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\n<br>\nHaving prepared a girl-drawn carriage, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\nHaving prepared a boy-drawn carriage, <br>\nthey’re drawn about from place to place. <br>\n<br>\nHaving ascended their vehicle, <br>\nthat king’s servants <br>\ntour about in every quarter, <br>\n<br>\nprovided with vehicles, <br>\nelephant, horse, and divine. <br>\nAnd there are mansions and palanquins <br>\nfor that great and glorious king. <br>\n<br>\nAnd he has cities, too, <br>\nwell-built in the sky: <br>\nĀṭānāṭā, Kusināṭā, Parakusināṭā, <br>\nNāṭasuriyā, and Parakusiṭanāṭā. <br>\n<br>\nTo the north is Kapīvanta, <br>\nand Jonogha lies beyond. <br>\nAnd there’s Navanavutiya, Ambara-ambaravatiya, <br>\nand the royal capital named Āḷakamandā. <br>\n<br>\nThe Great King Kuvera, dear sir, <br>\nhas a capital named Visāṇā, <br>\nwhich is why the great king <br>\nis called ‘Vessavaṇa’. <br>\n<br>\nThese each individually inform the King: <br>\nTatolā, Tattalā, Tatotalā, <br>\nOjasi, Tejasi, Tatojasi, <br>\nSūra, Rājā, Ariṭṭha, and Nemi. <br>\n<br>\nThere is a lake there too named Dharaṇī, <br>\nfrom whence the clouds rain down, <br>\nand the rains disperse. <br>\nThere is a hall there too named Bhagalavatī, <br>\n<br>\nwhere the spirits frequent. <br>\nThere the trees are ever in fruit, <br>\nwith many different flocks of birds. <br>\nPeacocks and herons call out there, <br>\nand the sweet cuckoos too. <br>\n<br>\nOne bird cries out ‘Live, live!’, <br>\nanother ‘Lift up your heart!’ <br>\nThere are cocks and kookaburras, <br>\nand in the wood the lotus-crane. <br>\n<br>\nThe parrots and mynah cry out there, <br>\nand the ‘little stick-boy’ birds. <br>\nKuvera’s pond of rushes <br>\nis lovely all the time. <br>\n<br>\nFrom here that is the northern quarter, <br>\nso the people say. <br>\nThat quarter is warded <br>\nby a great king, glorious, <br>\n<br>\nthe lord of spirits; <br>\nhis name is ‘Kuvera’. <br>\nHe delights in song and dance, <br>\nhonored by the spirits. <br>\n<br>\nAnd he has many mighty sons <br>\nall of one name, so I’ve heard. <br>\nEighty, and ten, and one— <br>\nall of them named Inda. <br>\n<br>\nAfter seeing the Awakened One, <br>\nthe Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun, <br>\nthey revere him from afar, <br>\nthe one great of heart and rid of naivety. <br>\n<br>\nHomage to you, O thoroughbred! <br>\nHomage to you, supreme among men! <br>\nYou’ve seen us with clarity and kindness. <br>\nThe non-humans bow to you. <br>\nWe’ve been asked many a time, <br>\n‘Do you bow to Gotama the victor?’ <br>\n<br>\nAnd so we ought to declare: <br>\n‘We bow to Gotama the victor, <br>\naccomplished in knowledge and conduct! <br>\nWe bow to Gotama the awakened!’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This, dear sir, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.</p>\n<p>The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen should learn this Āṭānāṭiya protection well and completely memorize it. If anyone who does so is approached while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down by any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, ministers, counselors, and servants among the spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—that non-human will receive no homage or respect in any village or town. And they will receive no ground or dwelling in my capital of Ālakamandā. Nor will they get to go to the conference of the spirits. In addition, the non-humans would not give or take them in marriage. They’d heap personal abuse on them, drop an empty bowl on their head, and even split their head into seven pieces!</p>\n<p>For there are, dear sir, non-humans who are fierce, cruel, and violent. They don’t obey the Great Kings or their men or their men’s men. They’re said to be rebelling against the Great Kings. They’re just like the bandits in the king of Magadha’s realm who don’t obey the king, his men, or his men’s men, and are said to be rebelling against the king.</p>\n<p>If any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, ministers, counselors, and servants among the spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—approaches a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one ought to yell, cry, and scream to the spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals: ‘This spirit’s got me! This spirit’s entered me! This spirit’s annoying me! This spirit’s harassing me! This spirit’s hurting me! This spirit’s harming me! This spirit won’t let me go!’</p>\n<p>To what spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Inda, Soma, and Varuṇa, <br>\nBhāradvāja, Pajāpati, <br>\nCandana and Kāmaseṭṭha, <br>\nKinnughaṇḍu and Nighaṇḍu, <br>\n<br>\nPanāda and Opamañña, <br>\nand Mātali, the god’s charioteer. <br>\nCittasena the fairy, <br>\nand the kings Nala and Janesabha, <br>\n<br>\nSātāgira, Hemavata, <br>\nPuṇṇaka, Karatiya, and Guḷa; <br>\nSivaka and Mucalinda, <br>\nVessāmitta, Yugandhara, <br>\n<br>\nGopāla, Supparodha, <br>\nHiri, Netti, and Mandiya; <br>\nPañcālacaṇḍa, Āḷavaka, <br>\nPajjunna, Sumana, Sumukha, <br>\nDadhimukha, Maṇi, Māṇivara, Dīgha, <br>\ntogether with Serīsaka.’ <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This, dear sir, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Well, now, dear sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”</p>\n<p>“Please, Great Kings, go at your convenience.”</p>\n<p>Then the Four Great Kings got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there. And before the other spirits present vanished, some bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.</p>\n<p>The first recitation section is finished.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/atanatiya-sutta/the-second-recitation-section/\">DN32.2.
