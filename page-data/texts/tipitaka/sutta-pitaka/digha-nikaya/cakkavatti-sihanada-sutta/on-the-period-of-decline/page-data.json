And they answered him. But after listening to them, he didn’t provide just protection and security. Nor did he pay money to the penniless in the realm. And so poverty grew widespread.</p>\n<p>When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft. They arrested him and presented him to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft.’</p>\n<p>The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’</p>\n<p>‘It’s true, sire.’</p>\n<p>‘What was the reason?’</p>\n<p>‘Sire, I can’t survive.’</p>\n<p>So the king paid some money to that person, saying, ‘With this money, mister, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man.</p>\n<p>But then another man stole something from others.

I’d better make an end of this person, finish him off, and chop off his head.’</p>\n<p>Then he ordered his men, ‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him, finish him off, and chop off his head.’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded.</p>\n<p>People heard about this: ‘It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others!’ It occurred to them, ‘We’d better have sharp swords made.

When backbiting was widespread, sexual misconduct became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom sexual misconduct was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.
