He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”</p>\n<p>Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika, “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then ask him whether he, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha consented in silence.</p>\n<p>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him, “I gave the Buddha your message, and he accepted.”</p>\n<p>And when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying: ‘It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.’”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha, and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding, “Sir, please dissuade him from that harmful misconception.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.”</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> <li>\n<h2><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/lohicca-sutta/questioning-lohicca/\">DN12.1.
