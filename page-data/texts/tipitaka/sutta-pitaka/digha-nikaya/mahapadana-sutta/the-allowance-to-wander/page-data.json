As the Buddha Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ‘The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. What if I was to urge them:</p>\n<p>“Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.”’</p>\n<p>Then a certain Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said, ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. Please urge them to wander, as you thought. And sir, I’ll make sure that when six years have passed the mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’</p>\n<p>That’s what that Great Brahmā said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Vipassī, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.</p>\n<p>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants, telling them all that had happened. Then he said,</p>\n<p>‘Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.

There will be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’</p>\n<p>Then most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very day.</p>\n<p>Now at that time there were 84,000 monasteries in India. And when the first year came to an end the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the first year has ended. Now five years remain. When five years have passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’</p>\n<p>And when the second year … the third year … the fourth year … the fifth year came to an end, the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the fifth year has ended. Now one year remains. When one year has passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’</p>\n<p>And when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the sixth year has ended. Now is the time that you must go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ Then that very day the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code. Some went by their own psychic power, and some by the psychic power of the deities.</p>\n<p>And there the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, recited the monastic code thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Patient acceptance is the highest austerity. <br>\nExtinguishment is the highest, say the Buddhas.<br>\nNo true renunciate injures another,<br>\nnor does an ascetic hurt another.<br>\n<br>\nNot to do any evil;<br>\nto embrace the good;<br>\nto purify one’s mind:<br>\nthis is the instruction of the Buddhas.<br>\n<br>\nNot speaking ill nor doing harm;<br>\nrestraint in the monastic code;<br>\nmoderation in eating;<br>\nstaying in remote lodgings;<br>\ncommitment to the higher mind—<br>\nthis is the instruction of the Buddhas.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/mahapadana-sutta/being-informed-by-deities/\">DN14.17.
