But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’</p>\n<p>And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this, <br>\nenough with trying to explain it!<br>\nThis teaching is not easily understood<br>\nby those mired in greed and hate.<br>\n<br>\nThose caught up in greed can’t see<br>\nwhat’s subtle, going against the stream,<br>\ndeep, hard to see, and very fine,<br>\nfor they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>Then a certain Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, thought, ‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’ Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said, ‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!’</p>\n<p>When he said this, the Buddha Vipassī said to him, ‘I too thought this, Brahmā, “Why don’t I teach the Dhamma?” Then it occurred to me, “If I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”</p>\n<p>So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’</p>\n<p>For a second time, and a third time that Great Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach.</p>\n<p>Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, the Buddha Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. And he saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.</p>\n<p>Then that Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, addressed him in verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Standing high on a rocky mountain, <br>\nyou can see the people all around. <br>\nIn just the same way, all-seer, wise one, <br>\nascend the palace built of Dhamma! <br>\nYou’re free of sorrow; but look at these people <br>\noverwhelmed with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age. <br>\n<br>\nRise, hero!
