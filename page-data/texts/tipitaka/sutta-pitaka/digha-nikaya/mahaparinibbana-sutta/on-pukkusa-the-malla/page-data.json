He saw the Buddha sitting at the root of a certain tree. He went up to him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations.</p>\n<p>Once it so happened that Āḷāra Kālāma, while traveling along a road, left the road and sat at the root of a nearby tree for the day’s meditation. Then around five hundred carts passed by right next to Āḷāra Kālāma. Then a certain person coming behind those carts went up to Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him: ‘Sir, didn’t you see the five hundred carts pass by?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I didn’t see them.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, were you asleep?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I wasn’t asleep.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, were you conscious?’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, friend.’ ‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to you? Why sir, even your outer robe is covered with dust!’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>\n<p>Then that person thought: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to him.’ And after declaring his lofty confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.”</p>\n<p>“What do you think, Pukkusa? Which is harder and more challenging to do while conscious and awake: to neither see nor hear a sound as five hundred carts pass by right next to you? Or to neither see nor hear a sound as it’s raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking?”</p>\n<p>“What do five hundred carts matter, or six hundred, or seven hundred, or eight hundred, or nine hundred, or a thousand, or even a hundred thousand carts? It’s far harder and more challenging to neither see nor hear a sound as it’s raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking!”</p>\n<p>“This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a threshing-hut. At that time it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And not far from the threshing-hut two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. Then a large crowd came from Ātumā to the place where that happened.</p>\n<p>Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking meditation in the open near the door of the hut. Then having left that crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I said to them, ‘Why, friend, has this crowd gathered?’</p>\n<p>‘Just now, sir, it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. Then this crowd gathered here. But sir, where were you?’</p>\n<p>‘I was right here, friend.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, did you see?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I didn’t see anything.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, were you asleep?’</p>\n<p>‘No, friend, I wasn’t asleep.’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, were you conscious?’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>\n<p>‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking?’</p>\n<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>\n<p>Then that person thought: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.’ And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving.”</p>\n<p>When he said this, Pukkusa said to him, “Any confidence I had in Āḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream. Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>\n<p>Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man, “Please, my man, fetch a pair of ready to wear polished golden garments.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then Pukkusa brought the garments to the Buddha, “Sir, please accept this pair of ready to wear polished golden garments from me out of compassion.”</p>\n<p>“Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Pukkusa, and did so.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.</p>\n<p>Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of golden garments on the Buddha’s body. But when placed on the Buddha’s body they seemed to lose their shine. Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how pure and bright is the color of the Realized One’s skin. When this pair of ready to wear polished golden garments is placed on the Buddha’s body they seem to lose their shine.”</p>\n<p>“That’s so true, Ānanda, that’s so true! There are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright. What two? The night when a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the night he becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over. These are the are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright.</p>\n<p>Today, Ānanda, in the last watch of the night, between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā, shall be the Realized One’s full extinguishment. Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Kakutthā River.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A pair of golden polished garments <br>\nwas presented by Pukkusa; <br>\nwhen the teacher was clothed with them, <br>\nhis golden skin glowed bright.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka, “Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having gone to Kakutthā Creek, <br>\nwhose water was transparent, sweet, and clear, <br>\nthe Teacher, being tired, plunged in, <br>\nthe Realized One, without compare in the world. <br>\n<br>\nAnd after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged. <br>\nBefore the group of mendicants, in the middle, the Buddha, <br>\nthe Teacher who rolled forth the present dispensation, <br>\nthe great hermit went to the mango grove. <br>\n<br>\nHe addressed the mendicant named Cundaka: <br>\n“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.” <br>\nThe self-developed one urged Cunda, <br>\nwho quickly spread the folded robe. <br>\nTeacher, being tired, lay down, <br>\nwhile Cunda sat there before him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:</p>\n<p>“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smith: ‘It’s your loss, friend Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last meal from you.’ You should get rid of remorse in Cunda the smith like this: ‘You’re fortunate, friend Cunda, you’re so very fortunate, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last meal from you. I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>There are two meal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other meal offerings. What two? The meal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the meal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over. These two meal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other meal offerings.</p>\n<p>You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’ That’s how you should get rid of remorse in Cunda the smith.”</p>\n<p>Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha was inspired to exclaim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A giver’s merit grows; <br>\nenmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control.<br>\nA skillful person gives up bad things— <br>\nwith the end of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re extinguished.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/mahaparinibbana-sutta/the-pair-of-sal-trees/\">DN16.26.
