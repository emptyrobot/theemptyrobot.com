Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he turned his whole body, the way that elephants do, to look back at Vesālī. He said to Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, this will be the last time the Realized One sees Vesālī. Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Bhaṇḍagāma.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Bhaṇḍagāma, and stayed there. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there are no more future lives.”</p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.
