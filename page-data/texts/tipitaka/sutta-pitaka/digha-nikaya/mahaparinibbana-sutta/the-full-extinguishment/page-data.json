Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>\n<p>Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Anuruddha, “Venerable Anuruddha, has the Buddha become fully extinguished?”</p>\n<p>“No, Reverend Ānanda. He has entered the cessation of perception and feeling.”</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.</p>\n<p>When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“All creatures in this world <br>\nmust lay down this bag of bones. <br>\nFor even a Teacher such as this, <br>\nunrivaled in the world, <br>\nthe Realized One, attained to power, <br>\nthe Buddha became fully extinguished.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, <br>\ntheir nature is to rise and fall; <br>\nhaving arisen, they cease; <br>\ntheir stilling is true bliss.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There was no more breathing <br>\nfor the poised one of steady heart. <br>\nImperturbable, committed to peace, <br>\nthe sage has done his time. <br>\n<br>\nHe put up with painful feelings <br>\nwithout flinching. <br>\nThe liberation of his heart <br>\nwas like the extinguishing of a lamp.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Then there was terror! <br>\nThen they had goosebumps! <br>\nWhen the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, <br>\nbecame fully extinguished.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the Buddha became fully extinguished, some of the mendicants there, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented: “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!” But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking, “Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?”</p>\n<p>Then Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart? The deities are complaining.”</p>\n<p>“But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?”</p>\n<p>“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in the sky and on the earth—who are percipient of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting: ‘Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!’ But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking: ‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’”</p>\n<p>Ānanda and Anuruddha spent the rest of the night talking about Dhamma.</p>\n<p>Then Anuruddha said to Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: ‘Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully extinguished. Please come at your convenience.’”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion.</p>\n<p>Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business. Ānanda went up to them, and announced, “Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully extinguished. Please come at your convenience.”</p>\n<p>When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/mahaparinibbana-sutta/the-rites-of-venerating-the-buddhas-corpse/\">DN16.37.
