At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Anupiya for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Anupiya. Why don’t I go to the wanderer Bhaggavagotta’s monastery to visit him?”</p>\n<p>So that’s what he did. Then the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said to the Buddha, “Come, Blessed One! Welcome, Blessed One! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”</p>\n<p>The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Bhaggavagotta took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said: ‘Now, Bhaggava, I have rejected the Buddha. Now I no longer live dedicated to him.’ Sir, is what Sunakkhatta said true?”</p>\n<p>“Indeed it is, Bhaggava.</p>\n<p>A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: ‘Now I reject the Buddha! Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you.’</p>\n<p>When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him, ‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘So it seems that I did not ask you to live dedicated to me, nor did you say you would live dedicated to me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? See how far you have strayed!’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.’</p>\n<p>‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me and I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for you”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for me”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’</p>\n<p>‘It does, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘So it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of superhuman demonstrations of psychic power? See how far you have strayed, you silly man!’</p>\n<p>‘But sir, the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to me.’</p>\n<p>‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me and I will describe the origin of the world to you”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to me”?’</p>\n<p>‘No, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not the origin of the world is described, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’</p>\n<p>‘It does, sir.’</p>\n<p>‘So it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of describing the origin of the world? See how far you have strayed, you silly man!</p>\n<p>In many ways, Sunakkhatta, you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capital: “That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.”</p>\n<p>In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capital: “The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”</p>\n<p>In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capital: “The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>\n<p>I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you! There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama. That’s why he rejected the training and returned to a lesser life. That’s what they’ll say.’</p>\n<p>Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/patika-sutta/on-korakkhattiya/\">DN24.2.
