In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. So long as that substantial self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.

This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?”</p>\n<p>“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.”</p>\n<p>“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal.

This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?”</p>\n<p>“This too has not been declared by me.”</p>\n<p>“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?”</p>\n<p>“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why I haven’t declared them.”</p>\n<p>“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?”</p>\n<p>“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.”</p>\n<p>“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?”</p>\n<p>“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.
