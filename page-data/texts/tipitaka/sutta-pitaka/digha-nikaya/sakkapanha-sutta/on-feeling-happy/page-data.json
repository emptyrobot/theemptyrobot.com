In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. It occurred to me as victor, ‘Now the gods shall enjoy both the nectar of the gods and the nectar of the demons.’ But sir, that joy and happiness is in the sphere of the rod and the sword. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. But the joy and happiness I feel listening to the Buddha’s teaching is not in the sphere of the rod and the sword.

I shall appoint you to your father’s position—you shall be king of the fairies. And I give you Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, who you love so much.”</p>\n<p>Then Sakka, touching the ground with his hand, was inspired to exclaim three times:</p>\n<p>“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!</p>\n<p>Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!</p>\n<p>Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”</p>\n<p>And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Sakka, lord of gods: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” And also for another 80,000 deities.</p>\n<p>Such were the questions Sakka was invited to ask, and which were answered by the Buddha. And that’s why the name of this discussion is “Sakka’s Questions”.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“Lord of gods, do you recall ever feeling such joy and happiness before?”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“I do, sir.”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“But how?”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“Once upon a time, sir, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
