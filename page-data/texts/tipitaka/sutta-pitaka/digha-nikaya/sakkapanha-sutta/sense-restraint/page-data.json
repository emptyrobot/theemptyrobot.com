There are two kinds of sound known by the ear … smells known by the nose … tastes known by the tongue … touches known by the body … thoughts known by the mind: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.”</p>\n<p>When the Buddha said this, Sakka said to him:</p>\n<p>“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement: You should not cultivate the kind of sight known by the eye which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline. And you should cultivate the kind of sight known by the eye which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow. You should not cultivate the kind of sound, smell, taste, touch, or thought known by the mind which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline. And you should cultivate the kind of thought known by the mind which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.</p>\n<p>Sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”</p>\n<p>And then Sakka asked another question:</p>\n<p>“Dear sir, do all ascetics and brahmins have the same doctrine, ethics, desires, and attachments?”</p>\n<p>“No, lord of gods, they do not.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“The world has many and diverse elements. Whatever element sentient beings insist on in this world of many and diverse elements, they obstinately stick to it, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have the same doctrine, ethics, desires, and attachments.”</p>\n<p>“Dear sir, have all ascetics and brahmins reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal?”</p>\n<p>“No, lord of gods, they have not.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“Those mendicants who are freed through the ending of craving have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal.”</p>\n<p>Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”</p>\n<p>And then Sakka asked another question:</p>\n<p>“Passion, sir, is a disease, an abscess, a dart. Passion drags a person to be reborn in life after life. That’s why a person finds themselves in states high and low. Elsewhere, among other ascetics and brahmins, I wasn’t even given a chance to ask these questions that the Buddha has answered. The dart of doubt and uncertainty has lain within me for a long time, but the Buddha has plucked it out.”</p>\n<p>“Lord of gods, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?”</p>\n<p>“I do, sir.”</p>\n<p>“If you wouldn’t mind, lord of gods, tell me how they answered.”</p>\n<p>“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.”</p>\n<p>“Well, speak then, lord of gods.”</p>\n<p>“Sir, I approached those who I imagined were ascetics and brahmins living in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. But they could not answer, and they even questioned me in return: ‘What is the venerable’s name?’ So I answered them: ‘Dear sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods.’ So they asked me another question: ‘But lord of gods, what deed brought you to this position?’ So I taught them the Dhamma as I had learned and memorized it. And they were pleased with just that much: ‘We have seen Sakka, lord of gods! And he answered our questions!’ Invariably, they become my disciples, I don’t become theirs. But sir, I am the Buddha’s disciple, a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/sakkapanha-sutta/on-feeling-happy/\">DN21.2.5.
