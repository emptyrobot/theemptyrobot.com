Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three she became one of my sons. There they knew him as the god Gopaka.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior fairy realm. There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants.</p>\n<p>At that, Gopaka scolded them, ‘Where on earth were you at, good sirs, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching! For while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled my ethics. I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three I became one of Sakka’s sons. Here they know me as the god Gopaka. But you, having led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior fairy realm.’</p>\n<p>When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods in that very life gained mindfulness leading to the host of Brahmā’s Ministers. But one god remained attached to sensuality.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I was a laywoman disciple of the seer, <br>\nand my name was Gopikā. <br>\nI was devoted to the Buddha and the teaching, <br>\nand I faithfully served the Saṅgha. <br>\n<br>\nBecause of the excellence of the Buddha’s teaching, <br>\nI’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, <br>\nreborn among the Three and Thirty. <br>\nAnd here they know me as Gopaka. <br>\n<br>\nThen I saw some mendicants who I’d seen before, <br>\ndwelling in the host of fairies. <br>\nWhen I used to be a human, <br>\nthey were disciples of Gotama. <br>\n<br>\nI served them with food and drink, <br>\nand clasped their feet in my own home. <br>\nWhere on earth were they at <br>\nwhen they learned the Buddha’s teachings? <br>\n<br>\nFor each must know for themselves the teaching <br>\nso well-taught, realized by the seer. <br>\nI was one who followed you, <br>\nhaving heard the fine words of the noble ones. <br>\n<br>\nI’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, <br>\nreborn among the Three and Thirty. <br>\nBut you followed the best of men, <br>\nand led the supreme spiritual life, <br>\n<br>\nbut still you’re born in this lesser realm, <br>\na rebirth not befitting. <br>\nIt’s a sorry sight I see, good sirs, <br>\nfellow Buddhists in a lesser realm. <br>\n<br>\nReborn in the host of fairies, <br>\nyou only wait upon the gods. <br>\nMeanwhile, I dwelt in a house— <br>\nbut see my distinction now! <br>\n<br>\nHaving been a woman now I’m a male god, <br>\nblessed with heavenly sensual pleasures.’ <br>\nScolded by that disciple of Gotama, <br>\nwhen they understood Gopaka, they were struck with urgency. <br>\n<br>\n‘Let’s strive, let’s try hard— <br>\nwe won’t serve others any more!’ <br>\nTwo of them aroused energy, <br>\nrecalling the Buddha’s instructions. <br>\n<br>\nRight away they became dispassionate, <br>\nseeing the drawbacks in sensual pleasures. <br>\nThe fetters and bonds of sensual pleasures— <br>\nthe ties of the Wicked One so hard to break— <br>\n<br>\nthey burst them like a bull elephant his ropes, <br>\nand passed right over the Thirty-Three. <br>\nThe gods with Inda and Pajāpati <br>\nwere all gathered in the Hall of Justice. <br>\n<br>\nAs they sat there, they passed over them, <br>\nthe heroes desireless, practicing purity. <br>\nSeeing them, Vāsava was struck with a sense of urgency; <br>\nthe master of gods in the midst of the group said, <br>\n<br>\n‘These were born in the lesser fairy realm, <br>\nbut now they pass us by!’ <br>\nHeeding the speech of one so moved, <br>\nGopaka addressed Vāsava, <br>\n<br>\n‘There is a Buddha, a lord of men, in the world. <br>\nKnown as the Sakyan Sage, he’s mastered the senses. <br>\nThose sons of his were bereft of mindfulness; <br>\nbut when scolded by me they gained it back. <br>\n<br>\nOf the three, there is one who remains <br>\ndwelling in the host of fairies. <br>\nBut two, recollecting the path to awakening, <br>\nserene, spurn even the gods.’ <br>\n<br>\nThe teaching’s explained in such a way <br>\nthat not a single disciple doubts it. <br>\nWe venerate the Buddha, the victor, lord of men, <br>\nwho has crossed the flood and cut off doubt. <br>\n<br>\nThey attained to distinction fitting <br>\nthe extent to which they understood the teaching here. <br>\nTwo of them mastered the distinction of <br>\nthe host of Brahmā’s Ministers. <br>\n<br>\nWe have come here, dear sir, <br>\nto realize this same teaching. <br>\nIf the Buddha would give me a chance, <br>\nI would ask a question, dear sir.” <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the Buddha thought, “For a long time now this spirit has led a pure life. Any question he asks me will be beneficial, not useless. And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.”</p>\n<p>So the Buddha addressed Sakka in verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ask me your question, Vāsava, <br>\nwhatever you want. <br>\nI’ll solve each and every <br>\nproblem you have.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first recitation section is finished.</p>\n<p>Having been granted an opportunity by the Buddha, Sakka asked the first question.</p>\n<p>“Dear sir, what fetters bind the gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies—and any of the other diverse creatures—so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate?”</p>\n<p>Such was Sakka’s question to the Buddha. And the Buddha answered him:</p>\n<p>“Lord of gods, the fetters of jealousy and stinginess bind the gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies—and any of the other diverse creatures—so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate.”</p>\n<p>Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”</p>\n<p>And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Sakka asked another question:</p>\n<p>“But dear sir, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of jealousy and stinginess? When what exists is there jealousy and stinginess? When what doesn’t exist is there no jealousy and stinginess?”</p>\n<p>“The liked and the disliked, lord of gods, are the source of jealousy and stinginess. When the liked and the disliked exist there is jealousy and stinginess. When the liked and the disliked don’t exist there is no jealousy and stinginess.”</p>\n<p>“But dear sir, what is the source of what is liked and disliked?”</p>\n<p>“Desire is the source of what is liked and disliked.”</p>\n<p>“But what is the source of desire?”</p>\n<p>“Thought is the source of desire.”</p>\n<p>“But what is the source of thought?”</p>\n<p>“Concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions are the source of thoughts.”</p>\n<p>“But how does a mendicant fittingly practice for the cessation of concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions?”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/digha-nikaya/sakkapanha-sutta/meditation-on-feelings/\">DN21.2.2.
