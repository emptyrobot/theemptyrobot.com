And how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the fourfold restraint? It’s when a Jain ascetic is obstructed by all water, devoted to all water, shaking off all water, pervaded by all water. That’s how a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint.

I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
