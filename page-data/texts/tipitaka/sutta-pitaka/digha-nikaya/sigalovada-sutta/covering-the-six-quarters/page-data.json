These six quarters should be recognized: parents as the east, teachers as the south, partner and children as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, bondservants and workers as beneath, and ascetics and brahmins as above.</p>\n<p>A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways, thinking: ‘I will support those who supported me. I’ll do my duty for them. I’ll maintain the family traditions. I’ll take care of the inheritance. When they have passed away, I’ll make an offering on their behalf.’ Parents served by the children in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They train them in a profession. They connect them with a suitable partner. They transfer the inheritance in due time. Parents served by their children in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the eastern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.</p>\n<p>A student should serve their teacher as the southern quarter in five ways: by rising for them, by serving them, by listening well, by looking after them, and by carefully learning their profession. Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They make sure they’re well trained and well educated. They clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession. They introduce them to their friends and colleagues. They provide protection in every region. Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the southern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.</p>\n<p>A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways: by treating her with honor, by not looking down on her, by not being unfaithful, by relinquishing authority to her, and by presenting her with adornments. A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in five ways. She’s well-organized in her work. She manages the domestic help. She’s not unfaithful. She preserves his earnings. She’s deft and tireless in all her duties. A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in these five ways. And that’s how the western quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.</p>\n<p>A gentleman should serve their friends and colleagues as the northern quarter in five ways: giving, kindly words, taking care, equality, and not using tricky words. Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They guard them when they’re negligent. They guard their property when they’re negligent. They keep them safe in times of danger. They don’t abandon them in times of trouble. They honor their descendants. Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the northern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.</p>\n<p>A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower quarter in five ways: by organizing work according to ability, by paying food and wages, by nursing them when sick, by sharing special treats, and by giving time off work. Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They get up first, and go to bed last. They don’t steal. They do their work well. And they promote a good reputation. Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the lower quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.</p>\n<p>A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in five ways: by loving deeds of body, speech, and mind, by not turning them away at the gate, and by providing them with material needs. Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They think of them with kindly thoughts. They teach them what they do not know. They clarify what they’ve already learned. They explain the path to heaven. Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the upper quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.”</p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Parents are the east, <br>\nteachers the south, <br>\nwives and child the west, <br>\nfriends and colleagues the north, <br>\n<br>\nservants and workers below, <br>\nand ascetics and brahmins above. <br>\nBy honoring these quarters <br>\na householder does enough for their family. <br>\n<br>\nThe astute and the virtuous, <br>\nthe gentle and the articulate, <br>\nthe humble and the kind: <br>\nthey’re who win glory. <br>\n<br>\nThe diligent, not lazy, <br>\nthose not disturbed by troubles, <br>\nthose consistent in conduct, the intelligent: <br>\nthey’re who win glory. <br>\n<br>\nThe inclusive, the makers of friends, <br>\nthe kind, those rid of stinginess, <br>\nthose who lead, train, and persuade: <br>\nthey’re who win glory. <br>\n<br>\nGiving and kindly words, <br>\ntaking care here, <br>\nand treating equally in worldly conditions, <br>\nas befits them in each case; <br>\nthese ways of being inclusive in the world <br>\nare like a moving chariot’s linchpin. <br>\n<br>\nIf there were no such ways of being inclusive, <br>\nneither mother nor father <br>\nwould be respected and honored <br>\nfor what they’ve done for their children. <br>\n<br>\nBut since these ways of being inclusive do exist, <br>\nthe astute do regard them well, <br>\nso they achieve greatness <br>\nand are praised.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When this was said, Sigālaka the householder’s son said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“And how, householder’s son, does a noble disciple cover the six quarters?
