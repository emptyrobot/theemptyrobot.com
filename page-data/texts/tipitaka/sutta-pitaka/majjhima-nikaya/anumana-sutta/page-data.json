At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”</p>\n<p>“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>\n<p>“Suppose a mendicant invites other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions don’t think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person doesn’t gain their trust.</p>\n<p>And what are the qualities that make them hard to admonish? Firstly, a mendicant has wicked desires, having fallen under the sway of wicked desires. This is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant glorifies themselves and puts others down. …</p>\n<p>They’re irritable, overcome by anger …</p>\n<p>They’re irritable, and hostile due to anger …</p>\n<p>They’re irritable, and stubborn due to anger …</p>\n<p>They’re irritable, and blurt out words bordering on anger …</p>\n<p>When accused, they object to the accuser …</p>\n<p>When accused, they rebuke the accuser …</p>\n<p>When accused, they retort to the accuser …</p>\n<p>When accused, they dodge the issue, distract the discussion with irrelevant points, and display annoyance, hate, and bitterness …</p>\n<p>When accused, they don’t accept the consequences of their deeds …</p>\n<p>They are offensive and contemptuous …</p>\n<p>They’re jealous and stingy …</p>\n<p>They’re devious and deceitful …</p>\n<p>They’re obstinate and vain …</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go. This too is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.</p>\n<p>These are the qualities that make them hard to admonish.</p>\n<p>Suppose a mendicant doesn’t invite other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re accepting, and take instruction respectfully.

And I don’t like or approve of this person. And if I were to fall under the sway of wicked desires, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’ A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not fall under the sway of wicked desires.’ …</p>\n<p>‘This person is attached to their own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go.

Have I fallen under the sway of wicked desires?’ Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that they have fallen under the sway of wicked desires. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities. But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that they haven’t fallen under the sway of wicked desires. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities. …</p>\n<p>Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that they are attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.
