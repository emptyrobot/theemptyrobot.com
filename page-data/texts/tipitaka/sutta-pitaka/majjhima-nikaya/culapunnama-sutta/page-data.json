At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.</p>\n<p>Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent.

It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know of a bad person: ‘This fellow is a bad person.’ But could a bad person know of a good person: ‘This fellow is a good person’?”</p>\n<p>“No, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Good, mendicants!
