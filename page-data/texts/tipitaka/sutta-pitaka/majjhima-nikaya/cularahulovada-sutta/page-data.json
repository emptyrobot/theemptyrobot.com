Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.</p>\n<p>Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.</p>\n<p>Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking, “Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!”</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>\n<p>“What do you think, Rāhula?
