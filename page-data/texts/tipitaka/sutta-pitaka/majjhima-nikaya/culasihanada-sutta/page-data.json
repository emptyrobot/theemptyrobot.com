At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>\n<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“‘Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics.’ This, mendicants, is how you should rightly roar your lion’s roar.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: ‘But what is the source of the venerables’ self-confidence and forcefulness that they say this?’ You should say to them: ‘There are four things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Seeing these things in ourselves we say that:</p>\n<p>“Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics.” What four? We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in the teaching, and we have fulfilled the precepts. And we have love and affection for those who share our path, both laypeople and renunciates. These are the four things.’</p>\n<p>It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: ‘We too have confidence in the Teacher—our Teacher; we have confidence in the teaching—our teaching; and we have fulfilled the precepts—our precepts. And we have love and affection for those who share our path, both laypeople and renunciates. What, then, is the difference between you and us?’</p>\n<p>You should say to them: ‘Well, reverends, is the goal one or many?’ Answering rightly, the wanderers would say: ‘The goal is one, reverends, not many.’</p>\n<p>‘But is that goal for the greedy or for those free of greed?’ Answering rightly, the wanderers would say: ‘That goal is for those free of greed, not for the greedy.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for the hateful or those free of hate?’ ‘It’s for those free of hate.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for the delusional or those free of delusion?’ ‘It’s for those free of delusion.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for those who crave or those rid of craving?’ ‘It’s for those rid of craving.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for those who grasp or those who don’t grasp?’ ‘It’s for those who don’t grasp.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for the knowledgeable or the ignorant?’ ‘It’s for the knowledgeable.’</p>\n<p>‘Is it for those who favor and oppose or for those who don’t favor and oppose?’ ‘It’s for those who don’t favor and oppose.’</p>\n<p>‘But is that goal for those who enjoy proliferation or for those who enjoy non-proliferation?’ Answering rightly, the wanderers would say: ‘It’s for those who enjoy non-proliferation, not for those who enjoy proliferation.’</p>\n<p>Mendicants, there are these two views: views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence. Any ascetics or brahmins who cling, hold, and attach to a view favoring continued existence will oppose a view favoring ending existence. Any ascetics or brahmins who cling, hold, and attach to a view favoring ending existence will oppose a view favoring continued existence.</p>\n<p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand these two views’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. They’re greedy, hateful, delusional, craving, grasping, and ignorant. They favor and oppose, and they enjoy proliferation.

They’re not freed from suffering, I say.</p>\n<p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these two views’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
