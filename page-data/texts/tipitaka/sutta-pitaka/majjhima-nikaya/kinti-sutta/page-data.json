At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra, in the Forest of Offerings. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>\n<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, is this what you think of me? ‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’”</p>\n<p>“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.”</p>\n<p>“If you don’t think of me that way, then what exactly do you think of me?”</p>\n<p>“We think of you this way: ‘The Buddha is compassionate and wants what’s best for us. He teaches out of compassion.’”</p>\n<p>“So it seems you think that I teach out of compassion.</p>\n<p>In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. You should train in these things in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling.</p>\n<p>As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching.</p>\n<p>Now, you might think, ‘These two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them: ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing. But the venerables should know that this is how such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be. Please don’t get into a fight about this.’ Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them: ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing. But the venerables should know that this is how such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be.

Remembering this, you should speak on the teaching and the training.</p>\n<p>As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, one of the mendicants might commit an offense or transgression. In such a case, you should not be in a hurry to accuse them. The individual should be examined like this: ‘I won’t be troubled and the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and hostile. They don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’ If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.</p>\n<p>But suppose you think this: ‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and hostile. However, they don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful. But for the other individual to get hurt is a minor matter. It’s more important that I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’ If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.</p>\n<p>But suppose you think this: ‘I will be troubled but the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and hostile.

In this case you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable among those who side with one party and say to them: ‘Reverend, as we were training, mutual tale-bearing came up. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he rebuke it?’ Answering rightly, the mendicant should say: ‘Yes, reverend, he would.’ ‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’ Answering rightly, the mendicant should say: ‘No, reverend, one cannot.’</p>\n<p>Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them: ‘Reverend, as we were training, mutual tale-bearing came up.

He taught me the Dhamma. After hearing that teaching I explained it to those mendicants. When those mendicants heard that teaching they were drawn away from the unskillful and established in the skillful.’ Answering in this way, that mendicant doesn’t glorify themselves or put others down. They answer in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.”</p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.
