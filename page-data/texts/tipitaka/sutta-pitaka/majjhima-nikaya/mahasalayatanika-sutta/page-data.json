At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>\n<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, I shall teach you the great discourse on the six sense fields. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, when you don’t truly know and see the eye, sights, eye consciousness, eye contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises conditioned by eye contact, you’re aroused by desire for these things.</p>\n<p>Someone who lives aroused like this—fettered, confused, concentrating on gratification—accumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future. And their craving—which leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms—grows. Their physical and mental stress, torment, and fever grow. And they experience physical and mental suffering.</p>\n<p>When you don’t truly know and see the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, mind contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises conditioned by mind contact, you’re aroused by desire for these things.</p>\n<p>Someone who lives aroused like this—fettered, confused, concentrating on gratification—accumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future.

Their physical and mental stress, torment, and fever are given up. And they experience physical and mental pleasure.</p>\n<p>The view of such a person is right view.
