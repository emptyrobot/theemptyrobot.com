At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>\n<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>\n<p>“Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They perceive earth as earth. But then they identify with earth, they identify regarding earth, they identify as earth, they identify that ‘earth is mine’, they take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive water as water. But then they identify with water … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive fire as fire. But then they identify with fire … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive air as air. But then they identify with air … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive creatures as creatures. But then they identify with creatures … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive gods as gods. But then they identify with gods … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the Creator as the Creator. But then they identify with the Creator … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive Brahmā as Brahmā. But then they identify with Brahmā … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the gods of streaming radiance as the gods of streaming radiance. But then they identify with the gods of streaming radiance … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the gods replete with glory as the gods replete with glory. But then they identify with the gods replete with glory … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the gods of abundant fruit as the gods of abundant fruit. But then they identify with the gods of abundant fruit … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the Overlord as the Overlord. But then they identify with the Overlord … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>\n<p>They perceive the dimension of infinite space as the dimension of infinite space.
