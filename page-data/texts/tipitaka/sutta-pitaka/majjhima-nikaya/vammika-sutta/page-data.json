At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.</p>\n<p>Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, went up to Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:</p>\n<p>“Monk, monk! This ant-hill fumes by night and flames by day. The brahmin said, ‘Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a bar: ‘A bar, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the bar! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a bullfrog: ‘A bullfrog, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the bullfrog! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a forked path: ‘A forked path, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the forked path! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a box: ‘A box, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the box! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a tortoise: ‘A tortoise, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the tortoise! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw an axe and block: ‘An axe and block, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the axe and block! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a lump of meat: ‘A lump of meat, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the lump of meat! Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’</p>\n<p>Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a dragon: ‘A dragon, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Leave the dragon! Do not disturb the dragon! Worship the dragon!’</p>\n<p>Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”</p>\n<p>That is what that deity said before vanishing right there.</p>\n<p>Then, when the night had passed, Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he asked:</p>\n<p>“Sir, what is the ant-hill? What is the fuming by night and flaming by day? Who is the brahmin, and who the sage? What are the sword, the digging, the bar, the bullfrog, the forked path, the box, the tortoise, the axe and block, and the lump of meat? And what is the dragon?”</p>\n<p>“Mendicant, ‘ant-hill’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.</p>\n<p>Thinking and considering all night about what you did during the day—this is the fuming at night. The work you apply yourself to during the day by body, speech, and mind after thinking about it all night—this is the flaming by day.</p>\n<p>‘Brahmin’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. ‘Sage’ is a term for the trainee mendicant.</p>\n<p>‘Sword’ is a term for noble wisdom. ‘Digging’ is a term for being energetic.</p>\n<p>‘Bar’ is a term for ignorance. ‘Throw out the bar’ means ‘give up ignorance, take up the sword, sage, and dig.’</p>\n<p>‘Bullfrog’ is a term for anger and distress. ‘Throw out the bullfrog’ means ‘give up anger and distress’ …</p>\n<p>‘A forked path’ is a term for doubt. ‘Throw out the forked path’ means ‘give up doubt’ …</p>\n<p>‘Box’ is a term for the five hindrances, that is: the hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. ‘Throw out the box’ means ‘give up the five hindrances’ …</p>\n<p>‘Tortoise’ is a term for the five grasping aggregates, that is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ‘Throw out the tortoise’ means ‘give up the five grasping aggregates’ …</p>\n<p>‘Axe and block’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. ‘Throw out the axe and block’ means ‘give up the five kinds of sensual stimulation’ …</p>\n<p>‘Lump of meat’ is a term for desire with relishing. ‘Throw out the lump of meat’ means ‘give up desire with relishing’ …</p>\n<p>‘Dragon’ is a term for a mendicant who has ended the defilements. This is the meaning of: ‘Leave the dragon! Do not disturb the dragon! Worship the dragon.’”</p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Kassapa the Prince was happy with what the Buddha said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/majjhima-nikaya/rathavinita-sutta/\">MN.24.
