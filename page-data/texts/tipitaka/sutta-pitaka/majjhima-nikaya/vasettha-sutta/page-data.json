At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.</p>\n<p>Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.</p>\n<p>Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discussion the question of how one is a brahmin.</p>\n<p>Bhāradvāja said this: “When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—then you’re a brahmin.”</p>\n<p>Vāseṭṭha said this: “When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—then you’re a brahmin.”</p>\n<p>But neither was able to persuade the other.</p>\n<p>So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, “Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.</p>\n<p>So they went to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re both authorized masters <br>\nof the three Vedas. <br>\nI’m a student of Pokkharasāti, <br>\nand he of Tārukkha. <br>\n<br>\nWe’re fully qualified <br>\nin all the Vedic experts teach. <br>\nAs philologists and grammarians, <br>\nwe match our teachers in recitation. <br>\nWe have a dispute <br>\nregarding the question of ancestry. <br>\n<br>\nFor Bhāradvāja says that <br>\none is a brahmin due to birth, <br>\nbut I declare it’s because of one’s actions. <br>\nOh seer, know this as our debate. <br>\n<br>\nSince neither of us was able <br>\nto convince the other, <br>\nwe’ve come to ask you, sir, <br>\nso renowned as the awakened one. <br>\n<br>\nAs people honor with joined palms <br>\nthe moon on the cusp of waxing, <br>\nbowing, they revere <br>\nGotama in the world. <br>\n<br>\nWe ask this of Gotama, <br>\nthe eye arisen in the world: <br>\nis one a brahmin due to birth, <br>\nor else because of actions? <br>\nWe don’t know, please tell us, <br>\nso that we can know a brahmin.” <br>\n<br>\n“I shall explain to you,” said the Buddha, <br>\n“accurately and in sequence, <br>\nthe taxonomy of living creatures, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nKnow the grass and trees, <br>\nthough they lack self-awareness. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nNext there are bugs and moths, <br>\nand so on, to ants and termites. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nKnow the quadrupeds, too, <br>\nboth small and large. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nKnow, too, the long-backed snakes, <br>\ncrawling on their bellies. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nNext know the fish, <br>\nwhose habitat is the water. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nNext know the birds, <br>\nflying with wings as chariots. <br>\nThey’re defined by their birth, <br>\nfor species are indeed diverse. <br>\n<br>\nWhile the differences between these species <br>\nare defined by their birth, <br>\nthe differences between humans <br>\nare not defined by their birth. <br>\n<br>\nNot by hair nor by head, <br>\nnot by ear nor by eye, <br>\nnot by mouth nor by nose, <br>\nnot by lips nor by eyebrow, <br>\n<br>\nnot by shoulder nor by neck, <br>\nnot by belly nor by back, <br>\nnot by buttocks nor by breast, <br>\nnot by genitals nor by groin, <br>\n<br>\nnot by hands nor by feet, <br>\nnot by fingers nor by nails, <br>\nnot by knees nor by thighs, <br>\nnot by color nor by voice: <br>\nnone of these are defined by birth <br>\nas it is for other species. <br>\n<br>\nIn individual human bodies <br>\nyou can’t find such distinctions. <br>\nThe distinctions among humans <br>\nare spoken of by convention. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off keeping cattle: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a farmer, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off various professions: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a professional, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off trade: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a trader, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off serving others: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas an employee, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off stealing: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a bandit, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off archery: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a soldier, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho lives off priesthood: <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a sacrificer, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone among humans <br>\nwho taxes village and nation, <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas a ruler, not a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nI don’t call someone a brahmin <br>\nafter the mother or womb they came from. <br>\nIf they still have attachments, <br>\nthey’re just someone who says ‘sir’. <br>\nOne with nothing, by not grasping: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nHaving cut off all fetters <br>\nthey have no anxiety. <br>\nThey’ve got over clinging, and are detached: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve cut the strap and harness, <br>\nthe reins and bridle too, <br>\nwith cross-bar lifted, they’re awakened: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAbuse, killing, caging: <br>\nthey endure these without anger. <br>\nPatience is their powerful army: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nNot irritable or stuck up, <br>\ndutiful in precepts and observances, <br>\ntamed, bearing their final body: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nLike rain off a lotus leaf, <br>\nlike a mustard seed off the point of a pin, <br>\nsensual pleasures slide off them: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey understand for themselves <br>\nin this life the end of suffering; <br>\nwith burden put down, detached: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nDeep in wisdom, intelligent, <br>\nexpert in the variety of paths; <br>\narrived at the highest goal: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nSocializing with neither <br>\nhouseholders nor the homeless. <br>\nA migrant without a shelter, few in wishes: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve laid down the rod <br>\nagainst creatures firm and frail; <br>\nthey don’t kill or cause to kill: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nNot fighting among those who fight, <br>\nthey’re extinguished among those who’ve taken up arms. <br>\nNot grasping among those who grasp: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve discarded greed and hate, <br>\nconceit and denigration, <br>\nlike a mustard seed off the point of a pin: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThe words they utter <br>\nare sweet, informative, and true, <br>\nand don’t offend anyone: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey don’t steal anything in the world, <br>\nlong or short, <br>\nfine or coarse, beautiful or ugly: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey have no hope <br>\nfor this world or the next; <br>\nfree of hope, detached: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey have no clinging, <br>\nknowledge has freed them of indecision, <br>\nthey’ve arrived at the culmination of the deathless: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve escaped clinging <br>\nto both good and bad deeds; <br>\nsorrowless, stainless, pure: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nPure as the spotless moon, <br>\nclear and undisturbed, <br>\nthey’ve ended desire to be reborn: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve got past this grueling swamp <br>\nof delusion, transmigration. <br>\nThey’ve crossed over to the far shore, <br>\nstilled and free of indecision. <br>\nThey’re extinguished by not grasping: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve given up sensual stimulations, <br>\nand have gone forth from lay life; <br>\nthey’ve ended rebirth in the sensual realm: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve given up craving, <br>\nand have gone forth from lay life; <br>\nthey’ve ended craving to be reborn: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve given up human bonds, <br>\nand gone beyond heavenly bonds; <br>\ndetached from all attachments: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey’ve given up liking and disliking, <br>\nthey’re cooled and free of attachments; <br>\na hero, master of the whole world: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey know the passing away <br>\nand rebirth of all beings; <br>\nunattached, holy, awakened: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nGods, fairies, and humans <br>\ndon’t know their destiny; <br>\nthe perfected ones with defilements ended: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey have nothing before or after, <br>\nor even in between; <br>\none with nothing, by not grasping: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nLeader of the herd, excellent hero, <br>\ngreat hermit and victor; <br>\nunstirred, washed, awakened: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nThey know their past lives, <br>\nand see heaven and places of loss, <br>\nand have attained the end of rebirth: <br>\nthat’s who I call a brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nFor name and clan are assigned <br>\nas mere convention in the world. <br>\nArising by mutual agreement, <br>\nthey’re assigned to each individual. <br>\n<br>\nFor a long time this misconception <br>\nhas prejudiced those who don’t understand. <br>\nIgnorant, they declare <br>\nthat one is a brahmin by birth. <br>\n<br>\nYou’re not a brahmin by birth, <br>\nnor by birth a non-brahmin. <br>\nYou’re a brahmin by your deeds, <br>\nand by deeds a non-brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nYou’re a farmer by your deeds, <br>\nby deeds you’re a professional; <br>\nyou’re a trader by your deeds, <br>\nby deeds are you an employee; <br>\n<br>\nyou’re a bandit by your deeds, <br>\nby deeds you’re a soldier; <br>\nyou’re a sacrificer by your deeds, <br>\nby deeds you’re a ruler. <br>\n<br>\nIn this way in accord with truth, <br>\nthe astute regard deeds. <br>\nSeeing dependent origination, <br>\nthey’re expert in deeds and their results. <br>\n<br>\nDeeds make the world go on, <br>\ndeeds make people go on; <br>\nsentient beings are bound by deeds, <br>\nlike a moving chariot’s linchpin. <br>\n<br>\nBy austerity and spiritual practice, <br>\nby restraint and by taming: <br>\nthat’s how to become a brahmin, <br>\nthis is the supreme brahmin. <br>\n<br>\nAccomplished in the three knowledges, <br>\npeaceful, with rebirth ended, <br>\nknow them, Vāseṭṭha, <br>\nas Brahmā and Sakka to the wise.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/majjhima-nikaya/subha-sutta/\">MN.99.
