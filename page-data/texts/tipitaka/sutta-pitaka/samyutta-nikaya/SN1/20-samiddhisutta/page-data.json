You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures.\nEnjoy human sensual pleasures!\nDon’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” </p>\n<p>“I’m not, good sir;\nI’m giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present.\nFor the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks.\nBut this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” </p>\n<p>“But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks?\nAnd how is this teaching visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves?” </p>\n<p>“I’m junior, good sir, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.\nI’m not able to explain this in detail.\nBut the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery.\nYou should go to him and ask about this matter.\nAnd you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” </p>\n<p>“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities.\nIf you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added: </p>\n<p>   “Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he’ll be close by.” </p>\n<p>When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi,\n“Ask, mendicant, ask! For I have arrived.” </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Sentient beings who perceive the communicable, <br>\nbecome established in the communicable. <br>\nNot understanding the communicable, <br>\nthey fall under the yoke of Death. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But having fully understood the communicable, <br>\nthey don’t identify as a communicator, <br>\nfor they have nothing <br>\nby which they might be described. <br>\nTell me if you understand, spirit.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.\nPlease teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you think that ‘I’m equal, <br>\nspecial, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments. <br>\nUnwavering in the face of the three discriminations, <br>\nyou’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’. <br>\nTell me if you understand, spirit.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.\nPlease teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Judging is given up, conceit rejected; <br>\ncraving for name and form is cut off right here. <br>\nThey’ve cut the ties, untroubled and free of hope. <br>\nThough gods and humans search for them <br>\nin this world and the world beyond, they never find them, <br>\nnot in heaven nor in any abode. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tell me if you understand, spirit.” </p>\n<p>“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You should never do anything bad <br>\nby speech or mind or body in all the world. <br>\nHaving given up sensual pleasures, mindful and aware, <br>\nyou shouldn’t keep doing what’s painful and pointless.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN1/21-sattisutta/\">SN.1.21.
