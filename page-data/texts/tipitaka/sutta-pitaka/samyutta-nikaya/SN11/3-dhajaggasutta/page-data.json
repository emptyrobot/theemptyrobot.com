He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee. </p>\n<p>But, mendicants, I say this:\nIf you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me:\n‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’\nThen your fear and terror will go away. </p>\n<p>If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching:\n‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’\nThen your fear and terror will go away. </p>\n<p>If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha:\n‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’\nThen your fear and terror will go away. </p>\n<p>Why is that?\nBecause the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground.” </p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.\nThen the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root, <br>\nor an empty hut, O mendicants, <br>\nrecollect the Buddha, <br>\nand no fear will come to you. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you can’t recollect the Buddha—<br>\nthe eldest in the world, the bull of a man—<br>\nthen recollect the teaching, <br>\nemancipating, well taught. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you can’t recollect the teaching—<br>\nemancipating, well taught—<br>\nthen recollect the Saṅgha, <br>\nthe supreme field of merit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus recollecting the Buddha, <br>\nthe teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants, <br>\nfear and terror <br>\nand goosebumps will be no more.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN11/4-vepacittisutta/\">SN.11.4.
