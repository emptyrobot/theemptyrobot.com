The wanderers said to him: </p>\n<p>“Reverend Sāriputta, there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that suffering is made by oneself.\nSome of them declare that suffering is made by another.\nSome of them declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another.\nSome of them declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another.\nWhat does the ascetic Gotama say about this? How does he explain it?\nHow should we answer so as to repeat what the ascetic Gotama has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” </p>\n<p>“Reverends, the Buddha said that suffering is dependently originated.\nDependent on what?\nDependent on contact.\nIf you said this you would repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth.
