He went to Sāriputta and said to him,\n“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, reverend,” replied Sāriputta. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,\n“Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment:\n‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases.” </p>\n<p>“Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such.” </p>\n<p>“Sir, did I not also say that\nI did not state the meaning in these words and phrases?” </p>\n<p>“Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘But Reverend Sāriputta, how have you known and seen so that you’ve declared enlightenment:\n“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI would answer:\n‘Reverends, because of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew “it is ended”.\nKnowing this,\nI understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘But what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth?’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI would answer:\n‘Continued existence is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth.’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘What is the source of continued existence?’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI’d answer:\n‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘What is the source of grasping?’ …\nBut Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘What is the source of craving?’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI’d answer:\n‘Feeling is the source of craving.’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present?’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI’d answer:\n‘Reverends, there are three feelings.\nWhat three?\nPleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.\nThese three feelings are impermanent,\nand what’s impermanent is suffering.\nWhen I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no longer present.’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“Good, good, Sāriputta!\nThe same point may also be briefly explained in this way:\n‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ </p>\n<p>But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:\n‘But Reverend, how have you been released that you declare enlightenment:\n“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”?’\nHow would you answer?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, if they were to ask me this,\nI’d answer:\n‘Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that defilements don’t defile me and I don’t look down on myself.’\nThat’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>\n<p>“Good, good, Sāriputta!\nThe same point may also be briefly explained in this way:\n‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic.
