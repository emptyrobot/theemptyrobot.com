Now is the time, Holy One!\nLet the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” they replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination:\n‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms.\nBut what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’\nWhile examining they know:\n‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms.\nThe source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’\nThey understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation.\nAnd they practice in line with that path.\nThis is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. </p>\n<p>They perform further inner self-examination:\n‘But what is the source of this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be?’\nWhile examining they know:\n‘The source of this attachment is craving.
