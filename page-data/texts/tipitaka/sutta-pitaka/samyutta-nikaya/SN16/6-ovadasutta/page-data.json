Who can recite longer?’” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this:\n‘Please mendicants, compete in studies to\nsee who can recite more and better and longer’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“If you’ve never known me to teach the Dhamma like this, then what exactly do you know and see, you foolish men, that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training you’d compete in studies to\nsee who can recite more and better and longer?” </p>\n<p>Then those monks bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said,\n“We have made a mistake, sir.

It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.\nBut since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.\nFor it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN16/7-dutiyaovadasutta/\">SN.16.7.
