They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>\n<p>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him,\n“Reverend Sāriputta, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.\nWe have consulted with the Teacher.” </p>\n<p>“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—\nastute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—\nfor astute people are inquisitive:\n‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. </p>\n<p>“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.\nMay Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, reverend,” they replied.\nSāriputta said this: </p>\n<p>“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—\nastute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—\nfor astute people are inquisitive:\n‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach?
