</p>\n<p>“Mendicants, in this teaching and training a mendicant who is skilled in seven cases and who examines in three ways is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person. </p>\n<p>And how is a mendicant skilled in seven cases?\nIt’s when a mendicant understands form, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.\nThey understand form’s gratification, drawback, and escape.\nThey understand feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.\nThey understand consciousness’s gratification, drawback, and escape. </p>\n<p>And what is form?\nThe four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements.\nThis is called form.\nForm originates from food.\nWhen food ceases, form ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of form is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.\nThat form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.\nRemoving and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape. </p>\n<p>Those ascetics and brahmins who have directly known form in this way—and its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation;\nits gratification, drawback, and escape—and are practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form: they are practicing well.\nThose who practice well have a firm footing in this teaching and training. </p>\n<p>Those ascetics and brahmins who have directly known form in this way—and its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation;\nits gratification, drawback, and escape—and due to disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form, are freed by not grasping: they are well freed.\nThose who are well freed are consummate ones.\nFor consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found. </p>\n<p>And what is feeling?\nThere are these six classes of feeling:\nfeeling born of eye contact …\nfeeling born of mind contact.\nThis is called feeling.\nFeeling originates from contact.\nWhen contact ceases, feeling ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling: this is its gratification.\nThat feeling is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.\nRemoving and giving up desire and greed for feeling: this is its escape. … </p>\n<p>And what is perception?\nThere are these six classes of perception:\nperceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.\nThis is called perception.\nPerception originates from contact.\nWhen contact ceases, perception ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path … </p>\n<p>And what are choices?\nThere are these six classes of intention:\nintention regarding sights …\nintention regarding thoughts.\nThese are called choices.\nChoices originate from contact.\nWhen contact ceases, choices cease.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold path … </p>\n<p>And what is consciousness?\nThere are these six classes of consciousness:\neye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness.\nThis is called consciousness.\nConsciousness originates from name and form.\nWhen name and form cease, consciousness ceases.\nThe practice that leads to the cessation of consciousness is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:\nright view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>\n<p>The pleasure and happiness that arise from consciousness: this is its gratification.\nThat consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.\nRemoving and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape. </p>\n<p>Those ascetics and brahmins who have directly known consciousness in this way—and its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its

freed are consummate ones.\nFor consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found.\nThat’s how a mendicant is skilled in seven cases. </p>\n<p>And how does a mendicant examine in three ways?\nIt’s when a mendicant examines the elements, sense fields, and dependent origination.\nThat’s how a mendicant examines in three ways. </p>\n<p>In this teaching and training, a mendicant who is skilled in seven cases and who examines in three ways is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person.” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a
