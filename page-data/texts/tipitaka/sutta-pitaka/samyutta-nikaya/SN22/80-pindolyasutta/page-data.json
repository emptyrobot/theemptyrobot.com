After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Great Wood,\nplunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation. </p>\n<p>Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,\n“I’ve sent the mendicant Saṅgha away.\nBut there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.\nNot seeing me they may change and fall apart.\nIf a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. …\nOr if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.\nIn the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.\nNot seeing me they may change and fall apart.\nWhy don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?” </p>\n<p>Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.\nHe arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:\n“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!\nThe Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away.\nBut there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. …\nMay the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!\nMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!\nMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!” </p>\n<p>The Buddha consented in silence.\nThen Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>\n<p>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out.\nThen he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs.\nThose mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: </p>\n<p>“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle.\nThe world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’\nYet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason.\nNot because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living.\nBut because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.\nAnd they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ </p>\n<p>That’s how this gentleman has gone forth.\nYet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties.\nSuppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness.\nI say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. </p>\n<p>There are these three unskillful thoughts.\nSensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.\nAnd where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over?\nIn those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion.\nJust this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion.\nWhen signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. </p>\n<p>There are these two views.\nViews favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence.\nA noble disciple reflects on this:\n‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’\nThey understand:\n‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault.\nFor in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling,\nperception,\nchoices, or consciousness.\nThat grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence.\nContinued existence is a condition for rebirth.\nRebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.\nThat is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>\n<p>What do you think, mendicants?\nIs form permanent or impermanent?” </p>\n<p>“Impermanent, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>\n<p>“Suffering, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:\n‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Is feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness permanent or impermanent?” … </p>\n<p>“So you should truly see … </p>\n<p>Seeing this …\nThey understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN22/81-palileyyasutta/\">SN.22.81.
