He took his seat and said to the Buddha: </p>\n<p>“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates, that is:\nform, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>\n<p>“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha. </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: </p>\n<p>“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?” </p>\n<p>“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” …\n“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?” </p>\n<p>“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>\n<p>“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?” </p>\n<p>“There can,” said the Buddha. </p>\n<p>“It’s when someone thinks:\n‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’\nThat’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>\n<p>“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?” </p>\n<p>“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.\nAny kind of feeling at all …\nAny kind of perception at all …\nAny kind of choices at all …\nAny kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.\nThat’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>\n<p>“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?\nWhat is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness is found?” </p>\n<p>“The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found.\nContact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling,\nperception,\nand choices are found.\nName and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>\n<p>“Sir, how does identity view come about?” </p>\n<p>“It’s because an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.\nThey regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.\nThey regard feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.\nThat’s how identity view comes about.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: </p>\n<p>“But sir, how does identity view not come about?” </p>\n<p>It’s because an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.\nThey don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.\nThey don’t regard feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.\nThat’s how identity view does not come about.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: </p>\n<p>“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,\nfeeling,\nperception,\nchoices,\nand consciousness?” </p>\n<p>“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.\nThat form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.\nRemoving and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.\nThe pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness: this is its gratification.\nThat consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.\nRemoving and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.” </p>\n<p>Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: </p>\n<p>“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?” </p>\n<p>“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’\nThey truly see any kind of feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’\nThat’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.” </p>\n<p>Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought: </p>\n<p>“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.\nThen what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?” </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: </p>\n<p>“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:\n‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.\nThen what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’\nNow, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases. </p>\n<p>What do you think, mendicants?\nIs form permanent or impermanent?” </p>\n<p>“Impermanent, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Is feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>\n<p>“Impermanent, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>\n<p>“Suffering, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:\n‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“So you should truly see …\nSeeing this …\nThey understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Two on the aggregates; exactly the same; and can there be; <br>\non the term; and on the cause; <br>\ntwo questions on identity; <br>\ngratification; and that with consciousness: <br>\nthese are the ten questions <br>\nthe mendicant came to ask.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN22/83-anandasutta/\">SN.22.83.
