Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.”\nBut even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it. </p>\n<p>When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said,\n“May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.”\nSāriputta consented in silence. </p>\n<p>Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him.
