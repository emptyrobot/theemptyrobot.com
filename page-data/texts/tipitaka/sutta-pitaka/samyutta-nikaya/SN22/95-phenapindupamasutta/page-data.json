For what substance could there be in form? </p>\n<p>Suppose it was the time of autumn, when the rain was falling heavily, and a bubble on the water forms and pops right away. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial.

And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception? </p>\n<p>Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a banana tree? </p>\n<p>In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of choices at all … examining them carefully. And they appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in choices? </p>\n<p>Suppose a magician or their apprentice was to perform a magic trick at the crossroads. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a magic trick? </p>\n<p>In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial.

When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.\nThey understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.\nThen the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Form is like a lump of foam; <br>\nfeeling is like a bubble; <br>\nperception seems like a mirage; <br>\nchoices like a banana tree; <br>\nand consciousness like a magic trick: <br>\nso taught the Kinsman of the Sun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However you contemplate them, <br>\nexamining them carefully, <br>\nthey’re void and hollow <br>\nwhen you look at them closely. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Concerning this body, <br>\nhe of vast wisdom has taught <br>\nthat when three things are given up, <br>\nyou’ll see this form discarded. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Vitality, warmth, and consciousness: <br>\nwhen they leave the body, <br>\nit lies there tossed aside, <br>\nfood for others, mindless. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Such is this process, <br>\nthis illusion, cooed over by fools. <br>\nIt’s said to be a killer, <br>\nfor no substance is found here. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An energetic mendicant <br>\nshould examine the aggregates like this, <br>\nwith situational awareness and mindfulness <br>\nwhether by day or by night. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They should give up all fetters, <br>\nand make a refuge for themselves. <br>\nThey should live as though their head was on fire, <br>\naspiring to the imperishable state.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN22/96-gomayapindasutta/\">SN.22.96.
