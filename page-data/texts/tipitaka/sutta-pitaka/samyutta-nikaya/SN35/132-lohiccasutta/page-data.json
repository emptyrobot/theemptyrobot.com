They walked and wandered all around the hut, making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers:\n“These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.” </p>\n<p>And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students,\n“Students, stop being so noisy.\nI will speak to you on the teaching.” </p>\n<p>When this was said, the students fell silent.\nThen Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The brahmins of old excelled in ethics, <br>\nand remembered the ancient traditions. <br>\nTheir sense doors were guarded, well protected, <br>\nand they had mastered anger. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those brahmins who remembered the ancient traditions <br>\nenjoyed virtue and absorption. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But these have lost their way. Claiming to recite, <br>\nthey live out of balance, judging everyone by their clan. <br>\nMastered by anger, they take up many arms, <br>\nattacking both the strong and the weak. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All is vain for someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors, <br>\nlike the wealth a person finds in a dream. <br>\nFasting, sleeping on bare ground, <br>\nbathing at dawn, the three Vedas, </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>rough hides, dreadlocks, and dirt, <br>\nhymns, precepts and observances, and self-mortification, <br>\nthose fake bent staffs, <br>\nand rinsing with water. <br>\nThese emblems of the brahmins <br>\nare only used to generate profits. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A mind that’s serene, <br>\nclear and undisturbed, <br>\nkind to all creatures: <br>\nthat’s the path to attainment of Brahmā!” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then those students, offended and upset, went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him,\n“Please, master, you should know this. The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins!” </p>\n<p>When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset.\nThen he thought,\n“But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students.\nWhy don’t I go and ask him about it?” </p>\n<p>Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. </p>\n<p>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him,\n“Master Kaccāna, did several young students of mine come by here collecting firewood?” </p>\n<p>“They did, brahmin.” </p>\n<p>“But did you have some discussion with them?” </p>\n<p>“I did.” </p>\n<p>“But what kind of discussion did you have with them?” </p>\n<p>“This is the discussion I had with these students.” </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Mahākaccāna repeats the verses.) <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Master Kaccāna spoke of someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors.\nHow do you define someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors?” </p>\n<p>“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.\nAnd they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>\n<p>When they hear a sound with their ears … </p>\n<p>When they smell an odor with their nose … </p>\n<p>When they taste a flavor with their tongue … </p>\n<p>When they feel a touch with their body … </p>\n<p>When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.\nAnd they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>\n<p>That’s how someone doesn’t guard the sense doors.” </p>\n<p>“It’s incredible, Master Kaccāna, it’s amazing!\nHow accurately you’ve explained someone whose sense doors are unguarded! </p>\n<p>You also spoke of someone who does guard the sense doors.\nHow do you define someone who does guard the sense doors?” </p>\n<p>“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it.
