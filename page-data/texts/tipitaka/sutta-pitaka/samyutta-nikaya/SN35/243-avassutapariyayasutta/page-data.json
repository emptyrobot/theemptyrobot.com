It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. </p>\n<p>Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,\n“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.\nMay the Buddha be the first to use it,\nand only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.\nThat would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”\nThe Buddha consented in silence. </p>\n<p>Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations, saying,\n“Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.\nThe Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.\nThe Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.\nThe Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, saying,\n“The night is getting late, Gotamas.\nPlease go at your convenience.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. </p>\n<p>And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,\n“Moggallāna, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.\nGive them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired.\nMy back is sore,\nI’ll stretch it.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Mahāmoggallāna replied.\nAnd then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. </p>\n<p>There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:\n“Reverends, mendicants!” </p>\n<p>“Reverend,” they replied.\nVenerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>\n<p>“I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.\nListen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, reverend,” they replied.\nVenerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>\n<p>“And how is someone corrupt? </p>\n<p>Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye.
