Sāriputta said to Channa:\n“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.\nThe winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.\nThe pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.\nThe winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.\nThe burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.\nI’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. </p>\n<p>Reverend Sāriputta, I will slit my wrists. I don’t wish to live.” </p>\n<p>“Please don’t slit your wrists!\nVenerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going. </p>\n<p>If you don’t have any suitable food, we’ll find it for you.\nIf you don’t have suitable medicine, we’ll find it for you.\nIf you don’t have a capable carer, we’ll find one for you. </p>\n<p>Please don’t slit your wrists!\nVenerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s not that I don’t have suitable food;\nI do have suitable food.\nIt’s not that I don’t have suitable medicine;\nI do have suitable medicine.\nIt’s not that I don’t have a capable carer;\nI do have a capable carer. </p>\n<p>Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.\nFor it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love.\nYou should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’” </p>\n<p>“I’d like to ask Venerable Channa about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” </p>\n<p>“Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’? </p>\n<p>Do you regard the ear … nose … tongue … body …\nmind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>\n<p>I regard the ear … nose … tongue … body …\nmind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?” </p>\n<p>“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.” </p>\n<p>When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa,\n“So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can: </p>\n<p>‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.\nWhen there’s no agitation there is tranquility.\nWhen there’s tranquility there’s no inclination.\nWhen there’s no inclination, there’s no coming and going.\nWhen there’s no coming and going, there’s no passing away and reappearing.\nWhen there’s no passing away and reappearing, there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two.\nJust this is the end of suffering.’” </p>\n<p>And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.\nNot long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists. </p>\n<p>Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,\n“Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists.\nWhere has he been reborn in his next life?” </p>\n<p>“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana\nwhere Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.” </p>\n<p>“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families, Sāriputta.\nBut this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’.\nWhen someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’.\nBut the mendicant Channa did no such thing. </p>\n<p>You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN35/88-punnasutta/\">SN.35.88.
