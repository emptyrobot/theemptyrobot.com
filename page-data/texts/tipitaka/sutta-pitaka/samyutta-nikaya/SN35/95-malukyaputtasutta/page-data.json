May the Holy one please teach me in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says. Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” </p>\n<p>“What do you think, Māluṅkyaputta?\nDo you have any desire or greed or fondness for sights known by the eye that you haven’t seen, you’ve never seen before, you don’t see, and you don’t think would be seen?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Do you have any desire or greed or affection for sounds known by the ear … </p>\n<p>smells known by the nose … </p>\n<p>tastes known by the tongue … </p>\n<p>touches known by the body … </p>\n<p>thoughts known by the mind that you haven’t known, you’ve never known before, you don’t know, and you don’t think would be known?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In that case, when it comes to things that are to be seen, heard, thought, and known: in the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard will be merely the heard; in the thought will be merely the thought; in the known will be merely the known.\nWhen this is the case,\nyou won’t be ‘by that’.\nWhen you’re not ‘by that’,\nyou won’t be ‘in that’.\nWhen you’re not ‘in that’,\nyou won’t be in this world or the world beyond or in between the two.\nJust this is the end of suffering.” </p>\n<p>“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘When you see a sight, mindfulness is lost <br>\nas attention latches on a pleasant feature. <br>\nExperiencing it with a mind full of desire,

good, Māluṅkyaputta!\nIt’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(The Buddha repeats the verses in full.) <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.” </p>\n<p>And then Venerable Māluṅkyaputta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.\nThen Māluṅkyaputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>\n<p>He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”\nAnd Venerable Māluṅkyaputta became one of the perfected. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN35/96-parihanadhammasutta/\">SN.35.96.
