In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings. </p>\n<p>I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.\nThis being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words. </p>\n<p>I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.\nThis being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes. </p>\n<p>There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.\nWhat five?\nSights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. …\nTouches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.\nThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.\nThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience.\nBut I don’t acknowledge that.\nWhy is that?\nBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than that. </p>\n<p>And what is that pleasure?\nIt’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nThis is a pleasure that is finer than that.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient

and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.\nThis is a pleasure that is finer than that.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience.\nBut I don’t acknowledge that.\nWhy is that?\nBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than that. </p>\n<p>And what is that pleasure?\nIt’s when, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’\nThis is a pleasure that is finer than that.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience.\nBut

happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.\nThis is a pleasure that is finer than that.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience.\nBut I don’t acknowledge that.\nWhy is that?\nBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than that. </p>\n<p>And what is that pleasure?\nIt’s when a mendicant—going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity—aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.\nThis is a pleasure that is finer than that.\nThere are those who would say\nthat this is the highest pleasure and
