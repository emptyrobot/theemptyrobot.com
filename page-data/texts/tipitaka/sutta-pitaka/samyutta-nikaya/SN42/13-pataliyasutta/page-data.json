Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?\nFor we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.” </p>\n<p>“Chief, those who say this repeat what I have said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Their explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.” </p>\n<p>“Sir, we didn’t believe that what those ascetics and brahmins said was really true.\nBut it seems the ascetic Gotama is a magician!” </p>\n<p>“Chief, does someone who says ‘I know magic’ also say ‘I am a magician’?” </p>\n<p>“That’s right, Blessed One! That’s right, Holy One!” </p>\n<p>“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. </p>\n<p>What do you think, chief?\nDo you know the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses?” </p>\n<p>“I know them, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And what’s their job?” </p>\n<p>“To put a stop to bandits and to deliver messages for the Koliyans.” </p>\n<p>“What do you think, chief?\nAre the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses moral or immoral?” </p>\n<p>“I know that they’re immoral, of bad character, sir. They are among those in the world who are immoral and of bad character.” </p>\n<p>“Would it be right to say that\nPāṭaliya knows the Kolyian officers with drooping headdresses who are immoral, of bad character, so he too must be immoral and of bad character.” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.\nI’m quite different from the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses, we have quite different characters.” </p>\n<p>“So if you can know those officers of bad character while you are not of bad character, why can’t the Realized One know magic, without being a magician? </p>\n<p>I understand magic and its result. And I understand how magicians practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. </p>\n<p>I understand killing living creatures and its result. And I understand how those who kill living creatures practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\nI understand stealing …\nsexual misconduct …\nlying …\ndivisive speech …\nharsh speech …\ntalking nonsense …\ncovetousness …\nill will …\nwrong view and its result. And I understand how those who have wrong view practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. </p>\n<p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:\n‘Everyone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life.\nEveryone who steals …\ncommits sexual misconduct …\nlies experiences pain and sadness in the present life.’ </p>\n<p>But you can see someone, garlanded and adorned, nicely bathed and anointed, hair and beard dressed, taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king.\nYou might ask someone:\n‘Mister, what did that man do?’\nAnd they’d reply:\n‘Mister, that man attacked the king’s enemy and killed them.\nThe king was delighted and gave him this reward.\nThat’s why he’s garlanded and adorned, nicely bathed and anointed, hair and beard dressed, taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king.’ </p>\n<p>And you can see someone else, his arms tied tightly behind his back with a strong rope. His head is shaven and he’s marched from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then he’s taken out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, they chop off his head.\nYou might ask someone:\n‘Mister, what did that man do?’\nAnd they’d reply:\n‘Mister, that man is an enemy of the king who has murdered a man or a woman.\nThat’s why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment.’ </p>\n<p>What do you think, chief?\nHave you seen or heard of such a thing?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” </p>\n<p>“Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that\neveryone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong?” </p>\n<p>“They’re wrong, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But those who speak hollow, false nonsense: are they moral or immoral?” </p>\n<p>“Immoral, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And are those who are immoral, of bad character practicing wrongly or rightly?” </p>\n<p>“They’re practicing wrongly, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And do those who are practicing wrongly have wrong view or right view?” </p>\n<p>“They have wrong view, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But is it appropriate to have confidence in those of wrong view?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“You can see someone, garlanded and adorned …\n‘Mister, that man attacked the king’s enemy and took their valuables.\nThe king was delighted and gave him this reward. …’ … </p>\n<p>And you can see someone else, his arms tied tightly behind his back …\n‘Mister, that man took something from a village or wilderness, with the intention to commit theft.\nThat’s why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment.’\nWhat do you think, chief?\nHave you seen or heard of such a thing?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” </p>\n<p>“Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that\neveryone who steals experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong? …\nIs it appropriate to have confidence in them?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“You can see someone, garlanded and adorned …\n‘Mister, that man had sexual relations with the wives of an enemy king.\nThe king was delighted and gave him this reward. …’ … </p>\n<p>And you can see someone else, his arms tied tightly behind his back …\n‘Mister, that man had sexual relations with the women and maidens of good families.\nThat’s why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment.’\nWhat do you think, chief?\nHave you seen or heard of such a thing?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” </p>\n<p>“Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that\neveryone who commits sexual misconduct experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong? …\nIs it appropriate to have confidence in them?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And you can see someone, garlanded and adorned …\n‘Mister, that man amused the king with lies.\nThe king was delighted and gave him this reward. …’ … </p>\n<p>And you can see someone else, his arms tied tightly behind his back …\n‘Mister, that man has ruined a householder or householder’s child by lying.\nThat’s why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment.’\nWhat do you think, chief?\nHave you seen or heard of such a thing?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” </p>\n<p>“Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that\neveryone who lies experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong?” </p>\n<p>“They’re wrong, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But those who speak hollow, false nonsense: are they moral or immoral?” </p>\n<p>“Immoral, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And are those who are immoral, of bad character practicing wrongly or rightly?” </p>\n<p>“They’re practicing wrongly, sir.” </p>\n<p>“And do those who are practicing wrongly have wrong view or right view?” </p>\n<p>“They have wrong view, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But is it appropriate to have confidence in those of wrong view?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir. </p>\n<p>It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!\nI have a guest house,\nwhere there are cots, seats, water pots, and oil lamps.\nWhenever an ascetic or brahmin comes to stay, I share what I have as best I can.\nOnce it so happened, sir, that four teachers of different views and opinions came to stay at my guest house. </p>\n<p>One teacher had this doctrine and view:\n‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously.

They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.
