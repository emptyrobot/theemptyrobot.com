The Buddha said to him,\n“Chief, how does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teach his disciples?” </p>\n<p>“Sir, this is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples:\n‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steal, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.\nYou’re led on by what you usually live by.’\nThis is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples.” </p>\n<p>“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. </p>\n<p>What do you think, chief?\nTake a person who kills living creatures. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re killing or when they’re not killing?” </p>\n<p>“The occasions when they’re killing are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not killing are more frequent.” </p>\n<p>“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. </p>\n<p>What do you think, chief?\nTake a person who steals … </p>\n<p>Take a person who commits sexual misconduct … </p>\n<p>Take a person who lies.
