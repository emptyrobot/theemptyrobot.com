Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to him: </p>\n<p>“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.\nThen you will get a good reputation:\n‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” </p>\n<p>“But sir, how am I to do this?” </p>\n<p>“Here, brahmin, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:\n‘Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?’\nWhen he’s asked this, if he answers:\n‘Indeed I do, chief,’ say this to him:\n‘So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw?\nThe Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’\nWhen you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Asibandhaka’s son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>\n<p>“Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?” </p>\n<p>“Indeed I do, chief.” </p>\n<p>“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw?\nThe Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!” </p>\n<p>“Well, chief, I recollect ninety eons back but I’m not aware of any family that’s been ruined merely by offering some cooked alms-food.\nRather, rich, affluent, and wealthy families—with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—all acquired their wealth because of generosity, truth, and restraint. </p>\n<p>Chief, there are eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families.\nTheir ruin stems from rulers, bandits, fire, or flood.

And impermanence is the eighth.\nThese are the eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families. </p>\n<p>Given that these eight reasons are found, suppose someone says this:\n‘The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’\nUnless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.” </p>\n<p>When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha,\n“Excellent, sir!
