He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to. </p>\n<p>But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there,\nso he went to the king and said to him, </p>\n<p>“Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to.\nBut there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.\nShe has a good reputation as being\nastute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent.\nYour Majesty may pay homage to her.” </p>\n<p>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her: </p>\n<p>“Ma’am, does a Realized One exist after death?” </p>\n<p>“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?” </p>\n<p>“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?” </p>\n<p>“This has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?” </p>\n<p>“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>\n<p>“Ma’am, when asked these questions, you say\nthat this has not been declared by the Buddha.\nWhat’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?” </p>\n<p>“Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.\nWhat do you think, great king? </p>\n<p>Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is,\nhow many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand?” </p>\n<p>“No, ma’am.” </p>\n<p>“Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is,\nhow many gallons of water there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water?” </p>\n<p>“No, ma’am.\nWhy is that?\nBecause the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.” </p>\n<p>“In the same way, great king, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.\nA Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,\nlike the ocean.\nTo say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply. </p>\n<p>Any feeling … </p>\n<p>perception …\nchoices … </p>\n<p>consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.\nA Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness.

Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving. </p>\n<p>Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
