How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” </p>\n<p>Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>\n<p>“What do you think, Anurādha?\nIs form permanent or impermanent?” </p>\n<p>“Impermanent, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>\n<p>“Suffering, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:\n‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Is feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>\n<p>“Impermanent, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>\n<p>“Suffering, sir.” </p>\n<p>“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:\n‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“So, Anurādha, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’\nAny kind of feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>\n<p>Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.\nBeing disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>\n<p>They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>\n<p>What do you think, Anurādha?\nDo you regard the Realized One as form?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling …\nperception …\nchoices …\nconsciousness?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“What do you think, Anurādha?\nDo you regard the Realized One as in form?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling …\nor distinct from feeling …\nas in perception …\nor distinct from perception …\nas in choices …\nor distinct from choices …\nas in consciousness …\nor as distinct from consciousness?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“What do you think, Anurādha?\nDo you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“What do you think, Anurādha?\nDo you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“In that case, Anurādha, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare:\n‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways:\nAfter death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?” </p>\n<p>“No, sir.” </p>\n<p>“Good, good, Anurādha!\nIn the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.” </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN44/3-pathamasariputtakotthikasutta/\">SN.44.3.
