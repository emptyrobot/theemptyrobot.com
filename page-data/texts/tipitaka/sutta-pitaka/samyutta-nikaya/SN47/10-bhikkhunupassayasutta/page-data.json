They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” </p>\n<p>“That’s how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters!\nAny monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to\nrealize a higher distinction than they had before.” </p>\n<p>Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.\nThen Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>\n<p>“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!\nAny monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to\nrealize a higher distinction than they had before. </p>\n<p>What four?\nIt’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nAs they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered.\nThat mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation.\nAs they do so, joy springs up.\nBeing joyful, rapture springs up.\nWhen the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.\nWhen the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.\nAnd when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.\nThen they reflect:\n‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind.\nLet me now pull back.’\nThey pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.\nThey understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings …\nmind …\nprinciples—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nAs they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered.\nThat mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation.\nAs they do so, joy springs up.\nBeing joyful, rapture springs up.\nWhen the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.\nWhen the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.\nAnd when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.\nThen they reflect:\n‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind.\nLet me now pull back.’\nThey pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.\nThey understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’\nThat’s how there is directed development. </p>\n<p>And how is there undirected development?\nNot directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’\nAnd they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’\nAnd they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’\nNot directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’\nAnd they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’\nAnd they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’\nNot directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’\nAnd they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’\nAnd they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’\nNot directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’\nAnd they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’\nAnd they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’\nThat’s how there is undirected development. </p>\n<p>So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development.\nOut of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.\nHere are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” </p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.\nSatisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN47/11-mahapurisasutta/\">SN.47.11.
