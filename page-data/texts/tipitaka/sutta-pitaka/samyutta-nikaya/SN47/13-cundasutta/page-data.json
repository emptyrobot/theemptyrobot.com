He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions.\nI remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.” </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that\nwe must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?\nHow could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?\nThat is not possible. </p>\n<p>Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off.\nIn the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. </p>\n<p>How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?\nThat is not possible. </p>\n<p>So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge.
