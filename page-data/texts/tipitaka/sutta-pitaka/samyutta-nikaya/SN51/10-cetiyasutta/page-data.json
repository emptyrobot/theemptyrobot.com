Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out.\nĀnanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.\nThe Buddha said to him: </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.\nWhoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.\nThe Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” </p>\n<p>But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.\nHe didn’t beg the Buddha,\n“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>\n<p>For a second time …\nand for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.\nWhoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.\nThe Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.

He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. </p>\n<p>And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: </p>\n<p>“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.\nSir, you once made this statement:\n‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ </p>\n<p>Today you do have such monk disciples.\nMay the Blessed One now become fully extinguished!

Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>\n<p>Sir, you once made this statement:\n‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … </p>\n<p>Today you do have such nun disciples.\nMay the Blessed One now become fully extinguished!
