The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>\n<p>“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?\nIt’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. </p>\n<p>Just mindful, they breathe in.
