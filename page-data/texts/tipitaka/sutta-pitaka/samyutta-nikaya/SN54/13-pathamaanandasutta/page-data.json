And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom. </p>\n<p>And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?\nIt’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.\nJust mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.\nWhen breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ …\nThey practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ </p>\n<p>When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’\n…\nThey practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’\nAt such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nWhy is that?\nBecause the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say.\nTherefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>\n<p>There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture …\nbliss …\nmind …’ …\nThey practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’\nAt such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nWhy is that?\nBecause close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say.\nTherefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>\n<p>There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’\nThey practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind …\nimmersing the mind in samādhi …\nfreeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’\nAt such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nWhy is that?\nBecause there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say.\nTherefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>\n<p>There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence …\nfading away …\ncessation …\nletting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’\nAt such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.\nHaving seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity.\nTherefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>\n<p>That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. </p>\n<p>And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors?\nWhenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body,\ntheir mindfulness is established and lucid.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. </p>\n<p>As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. </p>\n<p>As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. </p>\n<p>When you’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. </p>\n<p>When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. </p>\n<p>When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.\nAt such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion;
