And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.\nIt’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>\n<p>Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: </p>\n<p>“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes.\nWe wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.\nGiven that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” </p>\n<p>“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself.\nListen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” they replied.\nThe Buddha said this: </p>\n<p>“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself? </p>\n<p>It’s when a noble disciple reflects:\n‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain.\nSince this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that.\nBut others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either.\nThe thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.\nSince I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’\nReflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures.\nSo their bodily behavior is purified in three points. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:\n‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that.\nBut if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either.\nThe thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.\nSince I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’\nReflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves.
