She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. </p>\n<p>The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>\n<p>The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. </p>\n<p>It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away.\nBut if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me.\nSo Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:\n‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ </p>\n<p>And what is that mirror of the teaching? </p>\n<p>It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …\nthe teaching …\nthe Saṅgha …\nAnd they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.\nThis is that mirror of the teaching.\nA noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:\n‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.
