The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” </p>\n<p>Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.\nHe arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: </p>\n<p>“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!\nThere are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.\nThere will be those who understand the teaching!” </p>\n<p>This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past <br>\nan impure teaching thought up by those still stained. <br>\nFling open the door to the deathless! <br>\nLet them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Standing high on a rocky mountain, <br>\nyou can see the people all around. <br>\nIn just the same way, all-seer, wise one, <br>\nhaving ascended the Temple of Truth, <br>\nrid of sorrow, look upon the people <br>\nswamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, <br>\nwander the world without obligation. <br>\nLet the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! <br>\nThere will be those who understand!” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings.\nAnd the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. </p>\n<p>It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. </p>\n<p>In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. </p>\n<p>When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Flung open are the doors to the deathless! <br>\nLet those with ears to hear decide their faith. <br>\nThinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach <br>\nthe sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN6/2-garavasutta/\">SN.6.2.
