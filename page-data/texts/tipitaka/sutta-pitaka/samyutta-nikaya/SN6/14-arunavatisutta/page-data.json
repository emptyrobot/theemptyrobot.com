Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. </p>\n<p>But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected,\n‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!

Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. </p>\n<p>And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,\n‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’ </p>\n<p>Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī,\n‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha:\n“Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ </p>\n<p>‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin!\nStanding in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ </p>\n<p>‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder! <br>\nDevote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! <br>\nCrush the army of Death, <br>\nas an elephant a hut of reeds. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whoever will live diligently <br>\nin this teaching and training, <br>\ngiving up transmigration through rebirths, <br>\nwill make an end of suffering.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe,\nas easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants,\n‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ </p>\n<p>‘We did, sir.’ </p>\n<p>‘But what exactly did you hear?’ </p>\n<p>‘This is what we heard, sir: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Rouse yourselves!
