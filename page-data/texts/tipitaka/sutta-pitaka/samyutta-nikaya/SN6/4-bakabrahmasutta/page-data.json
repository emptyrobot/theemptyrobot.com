For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>\n<p>Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. </p>\n<p>Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance\nand said to him,\n“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!\nIt’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.\nFor this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>\n<p>When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,\n“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!\nBecause what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.\nAnd where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that\nthere’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.\nAnd although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers are now wielders of power, <br>\nhaving passed beyond rebirth and old age. <br>\nThis is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge-master. <br>\nAnd now many people pray to us.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long, <br>\nthough you think it’s long. <br>\nI know that your life span <br>\nis two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision, <br>\nwho has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow. <br>\nWhat precepts and observances did I practice in the past? <br>\nExplain to me so I can understand.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You gave drink to many people <br>\nwho were oppressed by thirst and heat. <br>\nThey’re the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. <br>\nI recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When people at Deer River Bank were seized, <br>\nyou released the captives as they were led away. <br>\nThat’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. <br>\nI recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a boat on the Ganges River was seized <br>\nby a fierce dragon desiring human flesh, <br>\nyou freed it wielding mighty force. <br>\nThat’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. <br>\nI recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I used to be your servant named Kappa. <br>\nYou thought he was intelligent and loyal. <br>\nThat’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. <br>\nI recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You certainly understand this life span of mine. <br>\nAnd others, too, you know; that’s why you’re the Buddha. <br>\nAnd that’s why your blazing glory <br>\nlights up even the Brahmā realm.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><a href=\"/texts/tipitaka/sutta-pitaka/samyutta-nikaya/SN6/5-annatarabrahmasutta/\">SN.6.5.
