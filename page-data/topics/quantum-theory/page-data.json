And yet this very topic has been a large focus of debate for centuries.</p>\n<h2>Do we have free will (free choice) or is free will an illusion?</h2>\n<p>The question of whether we consciously or subconsciously chose has been a topic of debate.\nSome have argued that our choices are subconscious and what our conscious is provided is both the choice and the options that were part of the subconscious selection process.</p>\n<h2>The philosophy of free will</h2>\n<p>Many philosophical figures have taken on the debate of free will, including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Reid, Friedrich Nietzsche, and many more.\nVarious beliefs create categories of viewpoints, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/determinism/\">Determinism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/indeterminism/\">Indeterminism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/compatibilism/\">Compatibilism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/incompatibilism/\">Incompatibilism</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ethics and moral responsibility</h2>\n<p>The question of free will brings up many moral and ethical questions.\nA belief in free will makes it easier to categorize things as right and wrong, good and evil.\nFree will allows for judgement.\nOn the other hand, if free will is an illusion, then the question of whether judgement be cast on against indiviudals for their actions comes into play.\nIn the siutation where no agency is present, people become products of their environment and genetics.\nThus the concepts of good and evil must diminish.</p>\n<h2>Free will, religion, and the soul</h2>\n<p>Without free will and judgement, there are many implications to the concept of the soul.\nThe moral and ethical debate around free will led philosophers, specifically those of Christian faith, to argue argue in favor of it.</p>\n<h2>Free will and Buddhism</h2>\n<p>Within <a href=\"/topics/buddhism/\">Buddhism</a> there is the concept of no-self, and the understanding that the self is an illusion.\nIf there is no self, who is it that wills?</p>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/consciousness-deliberation-and-choice/\">Consciousness, Deliberation, and Choice</a> - 1919 essay on free will by Chapman Cohen.</li>\n</ul>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"Consciousness","quote":"Cogito, ergo sum - René Descartes","description":"<h2>What is consciousness?</h2>\n<p>Consciousness refers to our awareness of our existence and is a complex topic that has been analyzed by philosophers and scientists for centuries. </p>\n<h2>The mind-body problem</h2>\n<p>The mind-body problem is the debate regarding the mind (consciousness) and the matter (physical world) and how they are related.\nThere are generally two main categories of approaches towards the mind-body problem, dualist and monist (non-dual) views.\nDualist views maintain that there is a distinction between the mind and the body, whereas monist views maintain that there is a single unifying reality.</p>\n<p>The philosopher Renee Descartes attempted to address the mind-body problem and explain the nature of consciousness by describing it as \"a substance distinct from matter,\" which he believed was linked to the soul.\nIn his book Discourse on the Method, he made the now famous statement Cogito, ergo sum (translated as “I think, therefore I am”).</p>\n<h2>The self</h2>\n<p>The self is the sense of identity that one has within their own consciousness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, take which of these suppositions you please, it is impossible to make personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness;

and so making human identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place personal identity, there will be difficulty to allow the same man to be the same person.\nBut then they who place human identity in consciousness only, and not in something else, must consider how they will make the infant Socrates the same man with Socrates after the resurrection.\nBut whatsoever to some men makes a man, and consequently the same individual man, wherein perhaps few are agreed, personal identity can by us be placed in nothing but consciousness, (which is that alone which makes what we call self) without involving us in great absurdities.</p>\n<p>-- John Locke (An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Subconsciousness</h2>\n<p>Consciousness includes all awareness or thoughts; hence subconsciousness refers to unconscious thought processes.\nThe subconscious is the part of the mind that our awareness has no direct visibility into, though it has direct impact to the parts of the mind we are aware of.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"Determinism","quote":"We ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow. - Pierre Simon Laplace","description":"<h2>What is Determinism (a definition)</h2>\n<p>Determinism is the belief that everything that happens in the universe is determined by previous events and conditions.\nThis includes human thought and actions, which implies that even our choices are a result of previous causes and conditions rather than decisions made of our own will.</p>\n<h2>Past, Present, and Future in a Deterministic Universe</h2>\n<p>Although there are practical limitations, if one presupposes a truly deterministic universe then having knowledge of all current states and all laws of nature, would allow us to have visibility into the past and the future.\nPierre Simon Laplace, wrote about this in his 18th century essay.\nThis thought experiment would later be known as Laplace’s demon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow.\nGiven for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it—an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis—it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom;\nfor it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.</p>\n<p>-- Pierre Simon Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities[3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Determinism and Science (Quantum Mechanics)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/topics/quantum-mechanics/\">Quantum mechanics</a>, as currently defined, is non-deterministic.\nThis has led many scientists to look for solutions that would allow it to become deterministic.\nEinstein, for example, was one supporter of a deterministic universe stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"God does not play dice with the universe\" - Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Determinism, Free will, and Morality</h2>\n<p>If all events are determined by previous events, then our choices are also determined by previous events.\nThis brings into question the nature of <a href=\"/topics/free-will/\">free will</a>.\nPhilosophers have struggled with this since it could undermine our sense of morality.\nIn a deterministic world, it is difficult to judge others for their actions, since the actions taken were not anything they had a choice in taking.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"Indeterminism","quote":"Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity. - Democritus","description":"<h2>What is Indeterminism (a definition)</h2>\n<p>Indeterminism is the belief that not everything that happens in the universe can be determined by previous events and conditions.\nIndeterminism states that events are probabilistic, rather than caused deterministically.\nThis is in contrast to <a href=\"/topics/determinism/\">determinism</a> which states that all events are determined by previous states and conditions.</p>\n<h2>Contrast to Determinism</h2>\n<p>The main difference between determinism and indeterminism is the introduction of chance and probabilities.\nWhereas with determinism one could predict the outcome given all states and laws of nature, with indeterminism, there is a only probability that the outcome will happen.</p>\n<h2>Indeterminism and Science (Quantum Mechanics)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/topics/quantum-mechanics/\">Quantum mechanics</a>, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, is non-deterministic which has led some scientists to argue in favor of a universe which is non-deterministic.\nScientists who believe the universe is deterministic have argued that the current quantum theory is incomplete, and that there is something, such as a hidden-variable, that we do not yet understand and once understood would give us a deterministic theory.</p>\n<h2>Indeterminism, Free will, and Morality</h2>\n<p>As opposed to determinism, Indeterminism opens up the door for <a href=\"/topics/free-will/\">free will</a> which can, according to some philosophers, help address the morality dilemma that some believe is created by removing choice from human behavior.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"Compatibilism","quote":"","description":null}},{"node":{"id":"Incompatibilism","quote":" ","description":null}},{"node":{"id":"Choice","quote":"Are the choices we make by volition or compulsion?","description":null}},{"node":{"id":"Mindfulness","quote":"Bring awareness to your experience.","description":null}},{"node":{"id":"Awareness","quote":"Awareness is like the sun.
