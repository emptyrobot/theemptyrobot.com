&lt;p&gt;The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.
The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader.
The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated.
In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation.
I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.
I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a “step-motherly” fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees.
May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for a new edition of Determinism or Free-Will is gratifying as affording evidence of the existence of a public, apart from the class catered for by more expensive publications, interested in philosophic questions[1]. It was, indeed, in the conviction that such a public existed that the book was written. Capacity, in spite of a popular impression to the contrary, has no very close relation to cash, nor is interest in philosophic questions indicated solely by the ability to spend a half-guinea or guinea on a work that might well have been published at three or four shillings. There exists a fairly large public of sufficient capacity and education intelligently to discuss the deeper aspects of life, but which has neither time nor patience to give to the study of bulky works that so often leave a subject more obscure at the end than it was at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does there appear any adequate reason why it should be otherwise. A sane philosophy must base itself on the common things of life, and must deal with the common experience of all men. The man who cannot find material for philosophic study by reflecting on those which are near at hand is not likely to achieve success by travelling all over the globe. He will only succeed in presenting to his readers a more elaborately acquired and a more expensively gained confusion. Nor is there any reason why philosophy should be discussed only in the jargon of the schools, except to keep it, like the religious mysteries, the property of the initiated few. We all talk philosophy, as we all talk prose, and doubtless many are as surprised as was M. Jourdain, when the fact is pointed out to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whatever merit this little work has is chiefly due to the avoidance, so far as possible, of a stereotyped phraseology, and to the elimination of irrelevant matter that has gathered round the subject. The present writer has long had the conviction that the great need in the discussion of ethical and psychological questions is their restatement in the simplest possible terms. The most difficult thing that faces the newcomer to these questions is to find out what they are really all about. Writer follows writer, each apparently more concerned to discuss what others have said than to deal with a straightforward discussion of the subject itself. Imposing as this method may be, it is fatal to enlightenment. For the longer the discussion continues the farther away from the original question it seems to get. One has heard of “The Religion of Philosophy,” and its acquisition of obscurity in thought and prolixity in language seems to have gone some distance towards earning the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being neither anxious to parade the extent of my reading, nor greatly overawed by the large number of eminent men who have written on the subject, I decided that what was needed was a plain statement of the problem itself. My concern, therefore, has been to keep out all that has not a direct bearing on the essential question, and only to deal with other writers so far as a discussion of what they say may help to make plain the point at issue. If the result does not carry conviction it at least makes clear the ground of disagreement. And that is certainly something gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a real need for a clearing away of all the verbal lumber that has been allowed to gather round subjects concerning which intelligent men and women will think even though they may be unable to reach reliable or satisfactory conclusions. And I have good grounds for believing that so far this little work has achieved the purpose for which it was written. If I may say it without being accused of conceit, it has made the subject clear to many who before found it incomprehensible. And, really, philosophy would not be so very obscure, if it were not for the philosophers. We may not always be able to find answers to our questions, but we ought always to understand what the questions are about. That it is not always the case is largely due to those who mistake obscurity for profundity, and in their haste to rise from the ground lose altogether their touch with the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much time in recitation. But some time later they adhered to passivity and silence.
Not hearing the teaching, the deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicant, why don’t you recite passages of the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
living together with other mendicants? &lt;br&gt;
When you hear the teaching confidence grows; &lt;br&gt;
and the reciter is praised in the present life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I used to be enthusiastic about passages of the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
so long as I’d not realized dispassion. &lt;br&gt;
But then I realized dispassion, which the good call &lt;br&gt;
the laying to rest by completely understanding &lt;br&gt;
whatever is seen, heard, and thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time that mendicant, during their day’s meditation, was thinking bad, unskillful thoughts to do with the lay life.
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You entered the woods desiring seclusion, &lt;br&gt;
yet your mind strays to outward things. &lt;br&gt;
As a person, you should dispel the desire for people. &lt;br&gt;
Then you’ll be happy, free of greed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindful, give up discontent; &lt;br&gt;
let us remind you of the way of the good. &lt;br&gt;
The dusty abyss is so hard to cross; &lt;br&gt;
don’t let sensual dust drag you down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a bird strewn with dirt &lt;br&gt;
sheds that clingy dust with a shake; &lt;br&gt;
so too, an energetic, mindful mendicant &lt;br&gt;
sheds that clingy dust with a shake.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time that mendicant, during their day’s meditation, was thinking bad, unskillful thoughts, that is:
sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of improper attention, &lt;br&gt;
you’re consumed by your thoughts. &lt;br&gt;
When you’ve given up irrationality, &lt;br&gt;
make sure your thoughts are rational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the Teacher, the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
the Saṅgha, and your own ethics, &lt;br&gt;
you’ll find gladness, &lt;br&gt;
and rapture and bliss as well, no doubt. &lt;br&gt;
And when you’re full of joy, &lt;br&gt;
you’ll make an end to suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deity haunting that forest had compassion for those mendicants, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached those mendicants wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mendicants used to live happily, &lt;br&gt;
as disciples of Gotama. &lt;br&gt;
Desireless they sought alms; &lt;br&gt;
desireless they used their lodgings. &lt;br&gt;
Knowing that the world was impermanent &lt;br&gt;
they made an end of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after, &lt;br&gt;
like chiefs in a village. &lt;br&gt;
They eat and eat and then lie down, &lt;br&gt;
unconscious in the homes of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha, &lt;br&gt;
I speak here only about certain people. &lt;br&gt;
They’re rejects, with no protector, &lt;br&gt;
just like those who have passed away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m speaking about &lt;br&gt;
those who live negligently. &lt;br&gt;
To those who live diligently &lt;br&gt;
I pay homage.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, those mendicants were struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the still of high noon, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time that mendicant fell asleep during the day’s meditation.
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get up, mendicant! Why lie down? &lt;br&gt;
What’s the point in sleeping? &lt;br&gt;
How can the afflicted slumber&lt;br&gt;
when injured by an arrow strike? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should amplify the faith &lt;br&gt;
that led you to go forth &lt;br&gt;
from the home life to homelessness. &lt;br&gt;
Don’t fall under the sway of slumber.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable, &lt;br&gt;
but idiots still fall for them. &lt;br&gt;
Among those who are bound, they’re free and unattached: &lt;br&gt;
why bother a renunciate? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing desire and greed, &lt;br&gt;
by going beyond ignorance, &lt;br&gt;
that knowledge has been perfectly cleansed: &lt;br&gt;
why bother a renunciate? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By breaking ignorance with knowledge, &lt;br&gt;
by the ending of defilements, &lt;br&gt;
they’re sorrowless, unstressed: &lt;br&gt;
why bother a renunciate? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energetic, resolute, &lt;br&gt;
always staunchly vigorous, &lt;br&gt;
aspiring to extinguishment: &lt;br&gt;
why bother a renunciate?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time, after the meal, on their return from alms-round, that mendicant plunged into a lotus pond and sniffed a pink lotus.
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This water flower has not been given. &lt;br&gt;
When you sniff it, &lt;br&gt;
this is one factor of theft. &lt;br&gt;
Good sir, you are a thief of scent!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not take, nor do I break; &lt;br&gt;
I sniff the water flower from afar. &lt;br&gt;
So based on what evidence &lt;br&gt;
do you call me a thief of scent? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you accuse someone &lt;br&gt;
who does such vandalizing &lt;br&gt;
as digging up the roots, &lt;br&gt;
or breaking off the flowers?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have nothing to say &lt;br&gt;
to a person who is a crude vandal, &lt;br&gt;
soiled like a used nappy. &lt;br&gt;
You’re the one who deserves to be spoken to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the man who has not a blemish &lt;br&gt;
who is always seeking purity, &lt;br&gt;
even a hair-tip of evil &lt;br&gt;
seems as big as a cloud.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, O spirit, you understand me, &lt;br&gt;
and you empathize with me. &lt;br&gt;
Please speak to me again, &lt;br&gt;
whenever you see something like this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no dependent of yours, &lt;br&gt;
nor am I your servant. &lt;br&gt;
You yourself should know, mendicant, &lt;br&gt;
the way that leads to a good place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses in the Forest are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after completing the three months of the rainy season residence, those mendicants set out wandering.
Not seeing those mendicants, the deity haunting that forest cried. And on that occasion they recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seeing so many vacated seats today, &lt;br&gt;
it seems to me that they must have become dissatisfied. &lt;br&gt;
They were so learned, such brilliant speakers! &lt;br&gt;
Where have these disciples of Gotama gone?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve gone to Magadha, they’ve gone to Kosala, &lt;br&gt;
and some are in the Vajjian lands. &lt;br&gt;
Like deer that wander free of ties, &lt;br&gt;
the mendicants live with no abode.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Kassapagotta, having withdrawn for his day’s meditation, tried to advise a tribal hunter.
Then the deity haunting that forest approached Kassapagotta wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A tribal hunter wandering the rugged hills &lt;br&gt;
is unintelligent, unthinking. &lt;br&gt;
It’s a waste of time to advise him; &lt;br&gt;
this mendicant seems to me like an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribal hunter listens without understanding, &lt;br&gt;
he looks without seeing. &lt;br&gt;
Though the teaching is spoken, &lt;br&gt;
the fool doesn’t get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you lit ten lamps &lt;br&gt;
and brought them to him, Kassapa, &lt;br&gt;
he wouldn’t see anything, &lt;br&gt;
for he has no eyes to see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, Venerable Kassapagotta was struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Ānanda, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve left for the jungle, the root of a tree, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three named Penelope had been Anuruddha’s partner in a former life. She went up to Anuruddha, and recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Set your heart there, &lt;br&gt;
where you used to live; &lt;br&gt;
among the gods of the Thirty-Three, &lt;br&gt;
whose every desire is granted! &lt;br&gt;
At the fore of a retinue &lt;br&gt;
of divine maidens, you’ll shine!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Divine maidens are in a sorry state, &lt;br&gt;
stuck in self-identity. &lt;br&gt;
And those beings too are in a sorry state, &lt;br&gt;
who are attached to divine maidens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t know pleasure &lt;br&gt;
who don’t see the Garden of Delight! &lt;br&gt;
It’s the abode of lordly gods, &lt;br&gt;
the glorious host of Thirty!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fool, don’t you understand &lt;br&gt;
the saying of the perfected ones: &lt;br&gt;
all conditions are impermanent, &lt;br&gt;
their nature is to rise and fall; &lt;br&gt;
having arisen, they cease; &lt;br&gt;
their stilling is true bliss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penelope, weaver of the web, &lt;br&gt;
there’ll be no more lives in the hosts of gods. &lt;br&gt;
Transmigration through births is finished, &lt;br&gt;
now there’ll be no more future lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time that monk had become too closely involved in the affairs of a certain family.
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that monk, wanting what’s best for him. So, wanting to stir him up, they manifested in the appearance of the mistress of that family, approached the monk, and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the banks of the rivers and in the guest houses, &lt;br&gt;
in meeting halls and highways, &lt;br&gt;
people come together and gossip: &lt;br&gt;
what’s going on between you and me?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are lots of annoying sounds &lt;br&gt;
that an austere ascetic must endure. &lt;br&gt;
But they mustn’t be dismayed by that, &lt;br&gt;
for that’s not what defiles you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re startled by every little sound, &lt;br&gt;
like a wind-deer in the wood, &lt;br&gt;
they’ll call you ‘flighty minded’; &lt;br&gt;
and your practice won’t succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Vajjis were holding an all-night event in Vesālī.
Then that mendicant, groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played, on that occasion recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We dwell alone in the wilderness, &lt;br&gt;
like a cast-off log in the forest. &lt;br&gt;
On a night like this, &lt;br&gt;
who’s worse off than me?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You dwell alone in the wilderness, &lt;br&gt;
like a cast-off log in the forest. &lt;br&gt;
Lots of people are jealous of you, &lt;br&gt;
like beings in hell of those going to heaven.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth. He had been left behind to look after the dwelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling.
When Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust infecting his mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he thought,
“It’s my loss, my misfortune,
that I’ve become dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction?
Why don’t I do it myself?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction, he recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now that I’ve renounced &lt;br&gt;
the home life for homelessness &lt;br&gt;
I’m overrun &lt;br&gt;
by the impudent thoughts of the Dark One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers, &lt;br&gt;
well trained, with strong bows, &lt;br&gt;
were to completely surround me; &lt;br&gt;
I would never flee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if women come, &lt;br&gt;
many more than that, &lt;br&gt;
they won’t scare me, &lt;br&gt;
for I stand firm in the teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard this with my own ears &lt;br&gt;
from the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun, &lt;br&gt;
about the path going to extinguishment; &lt;br&gt;
that’s what delights my mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wicked One, if you come near me &lt;br&gt;
as I meditate like this, &lt;br&gt;
I’ll make sure that you, Death, &lt;br&gt;
won’t even see the path I take.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Nāgadatta had been entering the village too early and returning late in the day.
Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Nāgadatta, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Entering too early, &lt;br&gt;
and returning after spending too much of the day, &lt;br&gt;
Nāgadatta socializes with lay people, &lt;br&gt;
sharing their joys and sorrows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid for Nāgadatta; he’s so reckless &lt;br&gt;
in his attachment to families. &lt;br&gt;
May he not come under the King of Death’s power, &lt;br&gt;
under the sway of the terminator!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impelled by that deity, Venerable Nāgadatta was struck with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Vaṅgīsa had recently attained perfection. While experiencing the bliss of freedom, on that occasion he recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We used to wander, drunk on poetry, &lt;br&gt;
village to village, town to town. &lt;br&gt;
Then we saw the Buddha, &lt;br&gt;
and faith arose in us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He taught me Dhamma: &lt;br&gt;
the aggregates, sense fields, and elements. &lt;br&gt;
When I heard his teaching &lt;br&gt;
I went forth to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was truly for the benefit of many &lt;br&gt;
that the sage achieved awakening—&lt;br&gt;
for the monks and for the nuns &lt;br&gt;
who see that they’ve reached certainty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so welcome for me &lt;br&gt;
to be in the presence of the Buddha. &lt;br&gt;
I’ve attained the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know my past lives, &lt;br&gt;
my clairvoyance is purified, &lt;br&gt;
I am master of three knowledges, attained in psychic power, &lt;br&gt;
expert in comprehending the minds of others.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa are complete.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,
“The Buddha is staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, seven hundred male and seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of deities.
And he outshines them all in beauty and glory.
Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like the moon on a cloudless night, &lt;br&gt;
like the shining immaculate sun, &lt;br&gt;
so too Aṅgīrasa, O great sage, &lt;br&gt;
your glory outshines the entire world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal, on his return from alms-round, he would enter his dwelling and not emerge for the rest of that day, or the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust infected his mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he thought,
“It’s my loss, my misfortune,
that I’ve become dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction?
Why don’t I do it myself?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction, he recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Giving up discontent and desire, &lt;br&gt;
along with all thoughts of the lay life, &lt;br&gt;
they wouldn’t get entangled in anything; &lt;br&gt;
unentangled, undesiring: that’s a real mendicant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether on this earth or in the sky, &lt;br&gt;
whatever in the world is included in form &lt;br&gt;
wears out, it is all impermanent; &lt;br&gt;
the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are bound to their attachments, &lt;br&gt;
to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought. &lt;br&gt;
Unstirred, dispel desire for these things; &lt;br&gt;
for one called ‘a sage’ does not cling to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached to the sixty wrong views, and full of their own opinions, &lt;br&gt;
ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles. &lt;br&gt;
But that mendicant wouldn’t join a sectarian group, &lt;br&gt;
still less would they utter lewd speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clever, long serene, &lt;br&gt;
free of deceit, alert, without envy, &lt;br&gt;
the sage has reached the state of peace; &lt;br&gt;
and because he’s extinguished, he awaits his time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa looked down upon other good-hearted mendicants because of his own poetic virtuosity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he thought,
“It’s my loss, my misfortune,
that I look down on other good-hearted mendicants because of my own poetic virtuosity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the occasion of arousing remorse in himself, he recited these verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give up conceit, Gotama! &lt;br&gt;
Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit! &lt;br&gt;
Besotted with the different kinds of conceit, &lt;br&gt;
you’ve had regrets for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smeared by smears and slain by conceit, &lt;br&gt;
people fall into hell. &lt;br&gt;
When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell, &lt;br&gt;
they grieve for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a mendicant who practices rightly, &lt;br&gt;
winner of the path, never grieves. &lt;br&gt;
They enjoy happiness and a good reputation, &lt;br&gt;
and they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Truth’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic, &lt;br&gt;
with hindrances given up, be pure. &lt;br&gt;
Then with conceit given up completely, &lt;br&gt;
use knowledge to make an end, and be at peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereupon, with his mind, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna checked to see whose mind was liberated and free of attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,
“The Buddha is staying on the slopes of Isigili … with five hundred perfected ones.
Mahāmoggallāna is checking to see whose mind is liberated and free of attachments.
Why don’t I extoll him in the Buddha’s presence with fitting verses?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Mahāmoggallāna in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the sage, who has gone beyond suffering, &lt;br&gt;
sits upon the mountain slope, &lt;br&gt;
he is revered by disciples with the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
destroyers of death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna, of great psychic power, &lt;br&gt;
comprehends with his mind, &lt;br&gt;
scrutinizing their minds, &lt;br&gt;
liberated, free of attachments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they revere Gotama, &lt;br&gt;
the sage gone beyond suffering, &lt;br&gt;
who is endowed with all path factors, &lt;br&gt;
and with a multitude of attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable Vaṅgīsa as his second monk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust infected his mind.
Then he addressed Ānanda in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got a burning desire for pleasure; &lt;br&gt;
My mind is on fire! &lt;br&gt;
Please, out of compassion, Gotama, &lt;br&gt;
tell me how to quench the flames.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your mind is on fire &lt;br&gt;
because of a perversion of perception. &lt;br&gt;
Turn away from the feature of things &lt;br&gt;
that’s attractive, provoking lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See all conditioned phenomena as other, &lt;br&gt;
as suffering and not-self. &lt;br&gt;
Extinguish the great fire of lust, &lt;br&gt;
don’t burn up again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With mind unified and serene, &lt;br&gt;
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body. &lt;br&gt;
With mindfulness immersed in the body, &lt;br&gt;
be full of disillusionment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditate on the signless, &lt;br&gt;
give up the underlying tendency to conceit; &lt;br&gt;
and when you comprehend conceit, &lt;br&gt;
you will live at peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.
What four?
It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely.
Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good people say that well-spoken words are foremost; &lt;br&gt;
second, speak on the teaching, not against it; &lt;br&gt;
third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; &lt;br&gt;
and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Speak only such words &lt;br&gt;
as do not hurt yourself &lt;br&gt;
nor harm others; &lt;br&gt;
such speech is truly well spoken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak only pleasing words, &lt;br&gt;
words gladly welcomed. &lt;br&gt;
Pleasing words are those &lt;br&gt;
that bring nothing bad to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth itself is the undying word: &lt;br&gt;
this is an ancient principle. &lt;br&gt;
Good people say that the teaching and its meaning &lt;br&gt;
are grounded in the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words spoken by the Buddha &lt;br&gt;
for realizing the sanctuary, extinguishment, &lt;br&gt;
for making an end of suffering: &lt;br&gt;
this really is the best kind of speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them:
“Come now, monks, I invite you all:
Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
“There is nothing, sir, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that we would criticize.
For the Blessed One is the one who gave rise to the unarisen path, who gave birth to the unborn path, who explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.
And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.
And sir, I invite the Blessed One.
Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that I would criticize.
Sāriputta, you are astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom.
A wheel-turning monarch’s oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father.
In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One’s criticism,
is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize.
For of these five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by wisdom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath, &lt;br&gt;
five hundred monks have gathered together to purify their precepts. &lt;br&gt;
These untroubled sages have cut off their fetters and bonds, &lt;br&gt;
they will not be reborn again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a wheel-turning monarch &lt;br&gt;
surrounded by ministers &lt;br&gt;
travels all around this &lt;br&gt;
land that’s girt by sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So disciples with the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
destroyers of death, &lt;br&gt;
revere the winner of the battle, &lt;br&gt;
the unsurpassed caravan leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are sons of the Blessed One—&lt;br&gt;
there is no rubbish here. &lt;br&gt;
I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun, &lt;br&gt;
destroyer of the dart of craving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, and expressed the meaning.
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,
“This Venerable Sāriputta is educating the mendicants. …
And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.
Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward Sāriputta, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta! I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Sāriputta in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Deep in wisdom, intelligent, &lt;br&gt;
expert in the variety of paths; &lt;br&gt;
Sāriputta, so greatly wise, &lt;br&gt;
teaches Dhamma to the mendicants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He teaches in brief, &lt;br&gt;
or he speaks at length. &lt;br&gt;
His call, like a myna bird, &lt;br&gt;
overflows with inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he teaches &lt;br&gt;
the mendicants listen to his sweet voice, &lt;br&gt;
sounding attractive, &lt;br&gt;
clear and graceful. &lt;br&gt;
They listen joyfully, &lt;br&gt;
their hearts uplifted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment.
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,

&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over a thousand mendicants &lt;br&gt;
revere the Holy One &lt;br&gt;
as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma, &lt;br&gt;
extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They listen to the immaculate Dhamma &lt;br&gt;
taught by the fully awakened Buddha; &lt;br&gt;
the Buddha is so brilliant, &lt;br&gt;
at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed One, your name is ‘Giant’, &lt;br&gt;
seventh of the sages. &lt;br&gt;
You are like a great cloud &lt;br&gt;
that rains on your disciples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve left my day’s meditation, &lt;br&gt;
out of desire to see the teacher. &lt;br&gt;
Great hero, your disciple Vaṅgīsa &lt;br&gt;
bows at your feet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaṅgīsa, had you previously composed these verses, or did they spring to mind in the moment?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They sprang to mind in the moment, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Vaṅgīsa, speak some more spontaneously inspired verses.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Vaṅgīsa. Then he extolled the Buddha with some more spontaneously inspired verses, not previously composed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having overcome Māra’s devious path, &lt;br&gt;
you wander with hard-heartedness dissolved. &lt;br&gt;
See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached, &lt;br&gt;
analyzing the teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has explained in many ways &lt;br&gt;
the path to cross the flood. &lt;br&gt;
The seers of Dhamma stand unfaltering &lt;br&gt;
in the deathless you’ve explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bringer of light who has pierced the truth, &lt;br&gt;
you’ve seen what lies beyond all states of being. &lt;br&gt;
When you saw and realized this for yourself, &lt;br&gt;
you taught it first to the group of five. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Dhamma has been so well taught, &lt;br&gt;
how could those who know it be negligent? &lt;br&gt;
So being diligent, we should always respectfully train &lt;br&gt;
in the Buddha’s teaching.”&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out praise for that bald ascetic.
Right now, lowlife woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? &lt;br&gt;
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? &lt;br&gt;
What is the one thing &lt;br&gt;
whose killing you approve?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease. &lt;br&gt;
When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
O brahmin, anger has a poisoned root &lt;br&gt;
and a honey tip. &lt;br&gt;
The noble ones praise its killing, &lt;br&gt;
for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood approached the Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
“I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,
“This Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood has approached the Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
‘I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña, Holy One!’

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Koṇḍañña in the Buddha’s presence with fitting verses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The senior monk who was awakened right after the Buddha, &lt;br&gt;
Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic. &lt;br&gt;
He regularly gains blissful meditative states, &lt;br&gt;
and the three kinds of seclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever can be attained by a disciple &lt;br&gt;
who does the Teacher’s bidding, &lt;br&gt;
he has attained it all, &lt;br&gt;
through diligently training himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great power and the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food.
Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms
and said to him,
“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat.
You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says:
‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You claim to be a farmer, &lt;br&gt;
but I don’t see your plough. &lt;br&gt;
If you’re a farmer, declare to me: &lt;br&gt;
how are we to understand your farming?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith is my seed, austerity my rain, &lt;br&gt;
and wisdom is my yoke and plough. &lt;br&gt;
Conscience is my pole, mind my strap, &lt;br&gt;
mindfulness my plowshare and goad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guarded in body and speech, &lt;br&gt;
I restrict my intake of food. &lt;br&gt;
I use truth as my scythe, &lt;br&gt;
and gentleness is my release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is my beast of burden, &lt;br&gt;
transporting me to a place of sanctuary. &lt;br&gt;
It goes without turning back &lt;br&gt;
to where there is no sorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how to do the farming &lt;br&gt;
that has the Deathless as its fruit. &lt;br&gt;
When you finish this farming &lt;br&gt;
you’re released from all suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eat, Master Gotama,
you are truly a farmer.
For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. &lt;br&gt;
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. &lt;br&gt;
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. &lt;br&gt;
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with other food and drink &lt;br&gt;
the consummate one, the great hermit, &lt;br&gt;
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. &lt;br&gt;
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time one of the brahmins of the Bhāradvāja clan had lost fourteen oxen.
While looking for them he went to that forest, where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there.
He went up to the Buddha, and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
fourteen oxen &lt;br&gt;
missing for the past six days: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
a field of sesame ruined, &lt;br&gt;
with just one or two leaves: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
rats in a vacant barn &lt;br&gt;
dancing merrily: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
carpets that for seven months &lt;br&gt;
have been infested with fleas: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
seven widowed daughters &lt;br&gt;
with one or two children each: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
a wife with blotchy, pockmarked skin &lt;br&gt;
to wake him up with a kick: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic mustn’t have &lt;br&gt;
creditors knocking at dawn, &lt;br&gt;
warning, ‘Pay up! Pay up!’: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why this ascetic is happy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
fourteen oxen &lt;br&gt;
missing for the past six days: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
a field of sesame ruined, &lt;br&gt;
with just one or two leaves: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
rats in a vacant barn &lt;br&gt;
dancing merrily: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
carpets that for seven months &lt;br&gt;
have been infested with fleas: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
seven widowed daughters &lt;br&gt;
with one or two children each: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
a wife with blotchy, pockmarked skin &lt;br&gt;
to wake me up with a kick: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, brahmin, I don’t have &lt;br&gt;
creditors knocking at dawn, &lt;br&gt;
warning, ‘Pay up! Pay up!’: &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m happy, brahmin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was afflicted by winds.
Venerable Upavāṇa was his carer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to Upavāṇa,
“Please, Upavāṇa, find some hot water for me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Upavāṇa. He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Devahita, and stood silently to one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devahita saw him standing there
and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Silent stands the Master, &lt;br&gt;
shaven, wrapped in his outer robe. &lt;br&gt;
What do you want? What are you looking for? &lt;br&gt;
What have you come here to ask for?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The perfected one, the Holy One in the world, &lt;br&gt;
the sage is afflicted by winds. &lt;br&gt;
If there’s hot water, &lt;br&gt;
give it to the sage, brahmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to bring it to the one &lt;br&gt;
who is esteemed by the estimable, &lt;br&gt;
honored by the honorable, &lt;br&gt;
venerated by the venerable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Devahita had a man fetch a carrying-pole with hot water. He also presented Upavāṇa with a jar of molasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Upavāṇa went up to the Buddha and bathed him with the hot water. Then he stirred molasses into hot water and presented it to the Buddha.
Then the Buddha’s illness died down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Devahita went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where should you give an available gift? &lt;br&gt;
Where is a gift very fruitful? &lt;br&gt;
How does one who is donating &lt;br&gt;
ensure the success of their religious donation?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One who knows their past lives, &lt;br&gt;
and sees heaven and places of loss, &lt;br&gt;
and has attained the ending of rebirth, &lt;br&gt;
that sage has perfect insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you should give an available gift; &lt;br&gt;
what’s given here is very fruitful. &lt;br&gt;
That’s how a sponsor of sacrifices &lt;br&gt;
ensures the success of their religious donation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Devahita said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a certain well-to-do brahmin, shabby, wearing a shabby cloak, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“Brahmin, why are you so shabby, wearing a shabby cloak?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, I have four sons.
At their wives’ bidding they expelled me from my house.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, brahmin, memorize these verses and recite them to your sons when you are all seated in the council hall with a large crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I was overjoyed when they were born, &lt;br&gt;
and wished for them the very best. &lt;br&gt;
But at their wives’ bidding they chased me out, &lt;br&gt;
like hounds after hogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out they’re wicked, those nasty men, &lt;br&gt;
though they called me their dear old Dad. &lt;br&gt;
They’re monsters in the shape of sons, &lt;br&gt;
throwing me out as I’ve grown old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an old, useless horse &lt;br&gt;
led away from its fodder, &lt;br&gt;
the elderly father of those kids &lt;br&gt;
begs for alms at others’ homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my staff is better &lt;br&gt;
than those disobedient sons, &lt;br&gt;
for it wards off a wild bull, &lt;br&gt;
and even a wild dog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes before me in the dark; &lt;br&gt;
in deep waters it supports me. &lt;br&gt;
By the wonderful power of this staff, &lt;br&gt;
when I stumble, I stand firm again.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having memorized those verses in the Buddha’s presence, the brahmin recited them to his sons when they were all seated in the council hall with a large crowd. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin’s sons led him back home, bathed him, and each clothed him with a fine pair of garments.
Then the brahmin, taking one pair of garments, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, we brahmins seek a fee for our teacher.
May Master Gotama please accept my teacher’s fee!”
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion.
Then the well-to-do brahmin said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Udaya.
Then Udaya filled the Buddha’s bowl with rice.
The next day … and the day after that … Udaya filled the Buddha’s bowl with rice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he had filled the Buddha’s bowl for a third time, he said to the Buddha,
“This insatiable ascetic Gotama keeps coming back again and again!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again and again, they sow the seed; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, the lord god sends rain; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, farmers plough the field; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, grain is produced for the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, the beggars beg; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, the donors give. &lt;br&gt;
Again and again, when the donors have given, &lt;br&gt;
again and again, they take their place in heaven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, dairy farmers milk; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, a calf cleaves to its mother; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, oppressing and intimidating; &lt;br&gt;
that idiot is reborn again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you’re reborn and die; &lt;br&gt;
again and again, you get carried to a charnel ground. &lt;br&gt;
But when they’ve gained the path for no further rebirth, &lt;br&gt;
one of vast wisdom is not reborn again and again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Udaya said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a brahmin named Stuck-Up was residing in Sāvatthī.
He didn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother.
Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Stuck-Up thought,
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.
Why don’t I approach him?
If he speaks to me, I’ll speak to him.
But if he doesn’t speak, neither will I.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Stuck-Up went up to the Buddha, and stood silently to one side.
But the Buddha didn’t speak to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Stuck-Up thought,
“This ascetic Gotama knows nothing!” And he wanted to go back from there right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing what Stuck-Up was thinking, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not good to foster conceit &lt;br&gt;
if you want what’s good for you, brahmin. &lt;br&gt;
You should foster the goal &lt;br&gt;
which brought you here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Stuck-Up thought,
“The ascetic Gotama knows my mind!” He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
“Master Gotama, I am Stuck-Up! I am Stuck-Up!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that assembly was stunned:
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
This brahmin Stuck-Up doesn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother.
Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Stuck-Up,
“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and take your own seat.
For your mind has confidence in me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Stuck-Up took his seat and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regarding whom should you not be conceited? &lt;br&gt;
Who should you respect? &lt;br&gt;
Who should you esteem? &lt;br&gt;
Who is it good to venerate properly?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your mother and father, &lt;br&gt;
and also your oldest brother, &lt;br&gt;
with teacher as fourth. &lt;br&gt;
Regarding these you should not be conceited. &lt;br&gt;
They are who you should respect. &lt;br&gt;
They are who you should esteem. &lt;br&gt;
And they’re who it’s good to venerate properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you’ve humbled conceit, and aren’t stuck-up, &lt;br&gt;
show supreme reverence for &lt;br&gt;
the perfected ones, cooled, &lt;br&gt;
their task complete, free of defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Stuck-Up said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a brahmin named Contraphile, who loved contradiction, was residing in Sāvatthī. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Contraphile thought,
“Why don’t I go to the ascetic Gotama and
contradict everything he says?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time the Buddha was walking mindfully in the open air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Contraphile went up to the Buddha, and said to him as he was walking,
“Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fine words aren’t easy to understand &lt;br&gt;
by a lover of contradiction, &lt;br&gt;
whose mind is tainted &lt;br&gt;
and full of aggression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you’ve dispelled aggression, &lt;br&gt;
and your suspicious mind, &lt;br&gt;
and you’ve got rid of resentment, &lt;br&gt;
then you’ll understand fine words.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Contraphile said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a brahmin who provided for his mother went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, I seek alms by legitimate means, which I use to provide for my mother and father.
In doing so, am I doing my duty?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, brahmin, in so doing you are doing your duty.
Whoever seeks alms by legitimate means, and uses them to provide for their mother and father makes much merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mortal provides for their mother &lt;br&gt;
and father by legitimate means; &lt;br&gt;
because they look after &lt;br&gt;
their parents like this, &lt;br&gt;
they’re praised in this life by the astute, &lt;br&gt;
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the brahmin who provided for his mother said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder was doing some building work in that jungle thicket.
He saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, it occurred to him,
“I enjoy doing this building work here in the jungle.
I wonder what the ascetic Gotama enjoys doing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bhāradvāja the Builder went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What kind of work do you do &lt;br&gt;
as a mendicant in the sal jungle? &lt;br&gt;
How do you find enjoyment &lt;br&gt;
alone in the wilderness, Gotama?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing I need to do in the jungle; &lt;br&gt;
my jungle’s cut down at the root, it’s withered away. &lt;br&gt;
With jungle cleared and free of thorns, &lt;br&gt;
I enjoy being alone in the jungle, having given up discontent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brahmin Bharadvāja the Rude heard a rumor that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, brahmin?
Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they do, Master Gotama.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you then serve them with a variety of foods and savories?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if they don’t accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In that case it still belongs to me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don’t accept it.
It still belongs to you, brahmin,
it still belongs to you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it.
But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it.
It still belongs to you, brahmin,
it still belongs to you!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The king and his retinue believe that Master Gotama is
a perfected one.
And yet he still gets angry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For one free of anger, tamed, living in balance, &lt;br&gt;
freed by right knowledge, &lt;br&gt;
a poised one who is at peace: &lt;br&gt;
where would anger come from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get angry at an angry person &lt;br&gt;
you just make things worse for yourself. &lt;br&gt;
When you don’t get angry at an angry person &lt;br&gt;
you win a battle hard to win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know that the other is angry, &lt;br&gt;
you act for the good of both &lt;br&gt;
yourself and the other &lt;br&gt;
if you’re mindful and stay calm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People unfamiliar with the teaching &lt;br&gt;
consider one who heals both &lt;br&gt;
oneself and the other &lt;br&gt;
to be a fool.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja the Rude said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja the Rude, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then several youths, students of one of the Bhāradvāja brahmins, approached a forest grove while collecting firewood. They saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. Seeing this, they went up to Bhāradvāja and said to him,
“Please sir, you should know this.
In such and such a forest grove the ascetic Gotama is sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bhāradvāja together with those students went to that forest grove
where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Deep in the jungle so full of terrors, &lt;br&gt;
you’ve plunged into the empty, desolate wilderness. &lt;br&gt;
Still, steady, and graceful: &lt;br&gt;
how beautifully you meditate, mendicant! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is no song or music, &lt;br&gt;
a lonely sage resorts to the wilderness. &lt;br&gt;
This strikes me as an amazing thing, &lt;br&gt;
that you dwell so joyfully alone in the jungle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you wish to be reborn in the company &lt;br&gt;
of the supreme sovereign of the heaven of the Three and Thirty. &lt;br&gt;
Is that why you resort to the desolate wilderness, &lt;br&gt;
to practice austerities for attaining Brahmā?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any wishes and hopes that are always attached &lt;br&gt;
to the many and various realms—&lt;br&gt;
the yearnings sprung from the root of unknowing—&lt;br&gt;
I’ve eliminated them all down to the root. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m wishless, unattached, disengaged; &lt;br&gt;
amongst all things, my vision is clear. &lt;br&gt;
I’ve attained the state of grace, the supreme awakening; &lt;br&gt;
I meditate alone, brahmin, and self-assured.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a begging brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, both you and I are beggars. What, then, is the difference between us?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t become a beggar &lt;br&gt;
just by begging from others. &lt;br&gt;
One who has undertaken domestic duties &lt;br&gt;
has not yet become a mendicant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one living a spiritual life &lt;br&gt;
who has shunned both merit and evil, &lt;br&gt;
and after appraisal, lives in this world: &lt;br&gt;
is said to be a mendicant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the begging brahmin said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Khomadussa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Khomadussa for alms.
Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa were gathered in the council hall for some business, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha approached that council.
The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,
and said,
“Who are these shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don’t they understand the council rules?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If good people are not present it is no true council; &lt;br&gt;
and those whose speak against principle are not good people. &lt;br&gt;
Having given up greed, hate, and delusion, &lt;br&gt;
speakers of principle are good people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practiced purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lived committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, there is a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practices purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lives committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk.
Please visit him at his home out of compassion.”
The Buddha consented in silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Saṅgārava, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then the brahmin Saṅgārava went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“Is it really true, brahmin, that you practice purification by water, believing in purification by water; that you live committed to the practice of immersing yourself in water at dawn and dusk?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Master Gotama.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But brahmin, for what reason do you practice purification by water?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s because, Master Gotama, whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the day I wash off by bathing at dusk; and whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the night, I wash off by bathing at dawn.
That’s the reason why I practice purification by water.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, &lt;br&gt;
unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. &lt;br&gt;
There the knowledge-masters go to bathe, &lt;br&gt;
and cross to the far shore without getting wet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

The brahmin Bharadvāja the Fiend heard a rumor to the effect that
a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bharadvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha,
“You’re beaten, ascetic, you’re beaten!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘Ha! I won!’ thinks the fool, &lt;br&gt;
when speaking with harsh words. &lt;br&gt;
Patience is the true victory &lt;br&gt;
for those who understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get angry at an angry person &lt;br&gt;
you just make things worse for yourself. &lt;br&gt;
When you don’t get angry at an angry person &lt;br&gt;
you win a battle hard to win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know that the other is angry, &lt;br&gt;
you act for the good of both &lt;br&gt;
yourself and the other &lt;br&gt;
if you’re mindful and stay calm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People unskilled in Dhamma &lt;br&gt;
consider one who heals both &lt;br&gt;
oneself and the other &lt;br&gt;
to be a fool.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Bharadvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha,

The brahmin Bharadvāja the Bitter heard a rumor that
a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and stood silently to one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing what Bhāradvāja the Bitter was thinking, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong, &lt;br&gt;
a pure man who has not a blemish, &lt;br&gt;
the evil backfires on the fool, &lt;br&gt;
like fine dust thrown upwind.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Bitter said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” …
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Matted hair within, matted hair without: &lt;br&gt;
these people are tangled up in matted hair. &lt;br&gt;
I ask you this, Gotama: &lt;br&gt;
who can untangle this tangled mass?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A wise man grounded in ethics, &lt;br&gt;
developing the mind and wisdom, &lt;br&gt;
a keen and alert mendicant, &lt;br&gt;
can untangle this tangled mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance&lt;br&gt;
have faded away;&lt;br&gt;
the perfected ones with defilements ended—&lt;br&gt;
the tangle has been untangled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where name and form &lt;br&gt;
cease with nothing left over; &lt;br&gt;
and impingement and perception of form: &lt;br&gt;
it’s there that the tangle is cut.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” …
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time ghee and milk-rice had been set out for the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper, who thought,
“I will serve the sacred flame! I will perform the fire sacrifice!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Rājagaha, he approached Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper’s home and stood to one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper saw him standing for alms
and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One who’s accomplished in the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
of good lineage and ample learning, &lt;br&gt;
accomplished in knowledge and conduct &lt;br&gt;
may enjoy this milk-rice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even one who mutters many invocations &lt;br&gt;
is no brahmin by birth &lt;br&gt;
if they’re filthy and corrupt within, &lt;br&gt;
with a following gained by fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one who knows their past lives, &lt;br&gt;
and sees heaven and places of loss, &lt;br&gt;
and has attained the ending of rebirth, &lt;br&gt;
that sage has perfect insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these three knowledges &lt;br&gt;
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges. &lt;br&gt;
Accomplished in knowledge and conduct, &lt;br&gt;
they may enjoy this milk-rice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eat, Master Gotama!
you are truly a brahmin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. &lt;br&gt;
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. &lt;br&gt;
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. &lt;br&gt;
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with other food and drink &lt;br&gt;
the consummate one, the great hermit, &lt;br&gt;
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. &lt;br&gt;
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” …
And Venerable Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

“I am Harmless, Master Gotama, I am Harmless!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you were really like your name, &lt;br&gt;
then you’d be Harmless. &lt;br&gt;
But a truly harmless person &lt;br&gt;
does no harm by way of &lt;br&gt;
body, speech, or mind; &lt;br&gt;
they don’t harm anyone else.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and recited this verse in his presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No brahmin in the world is ever purified &lt;br&gt;
even though he’s ethical and mortifies himself. &lt;br&gt;
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct &lt;br&gt;
is purified, not these commoners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even one who mutters many invocations &lt;br&gt;
is no brahmin by birth &lt;br&gt;
if they’re filthy and corrupt within, &lt;br&gt;
supporting themselves by fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you’re an aristocrat, &lt;br&gt;
a brahmin, merchant, worker, or an outcaste or scavenger—&lt;br&gt;
if you’re energetic and resolute, &lt;br&gt;
always staunchly vigorous, &lt;br&gt;
you’ll attain ultimate happiness. &lt;br&gt;
Know that for a fact, brahmin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …” …
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the river Sundarika. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he looked all around the four directions, wondering,
“Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head.
Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha.
When he heard Sundarika’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sundarika thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he thought,
“Even some brahmins are shaven.
Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Sundarika the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and said to him,
“Sir, in what caste were you born?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct;&lt;br&gt;
for any wood can surely generate fire. &lt;br&gt;
A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, &lt;br&gt;
is a thoroughbred checked by conscience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, &lt;br&gt;
a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey—&lt;br&gt;
that’s who a sacrificer should introduce themselves to, &lt;br&gt;
and make a timely offering to one worthy of a religious donation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My sacrificial offering must have been well performed, &lt;br&gt;
since I have met such a knowledge master! &lt;br&gt;
It’s because I’d never met anyone like you &lt;br&gt;
that others ate the leftover offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat, Master Gotama,
you are truly a brahmin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. &lt;br&gt;
That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. &lt;br&gt;
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. &lt;br&gt;
Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with other food and drink &lt;br&gt;
the consummate one, the great hermit, &lt;br&gt;
with defilements ended and remorse stilled. &lt;br&gt;
For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples.
Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Sundarika dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures.
And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming.
In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Sundarika the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side.
The Buddha addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin, &lt;br&gt;
don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external. &lt;br&gt;
Experts say that those who wish for purity &lt;br&gt;
through externals will not find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin, &lt;br&gt;
now I just light the inner flame. &lt;br&gt;
Always blazing, always serene, &lt;br&gt;
I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions, &lt;br&gt;
anger your smoke, and lies your ashes. &lt;br&gt;
The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar; &lt;br&gt;
a well-tamed self is a person’s light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, &lt;br&gt;
unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. &lt;br&gt;
There the knowledge-masters go to bathe, &lt;br&gt;
and cross to the far shore without getting wet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life; &lt;br&gt;
the attainment of the supreme based on the middle, brahmin. &lt;br&gt;
Pay homage to the upright ones—&lt;br&gt;
I declare that man to be one who follows the teaching.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama …” …
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it.
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.
It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve struggled hard to realize this, &lt;br&gt;
enough with trying to explain it! &lt;br&gt;
This principle is not easily understood &lt;br&gt;
by those mired in greed and hate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those caught up in greed can’t see &lt;br&gt;
what’s subtle, going against the stream, &lt;br&gt;
deep, hard to see, and very fine, &lt;br&gt;
for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought,
“Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past &lt;br&gt;
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. &lt;br&gt;
Fling open the door to the deathless! &lt;br&gt;
Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing high on a rocky mountain, &lt;br&gt;
you can see the people all around. &lt;br&gt;
In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, &lt;br&gt;
having ascended the Temple of Truth, &lt;br&gt;
rid of sorrow, look upon the people &lt;br&gt;
swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, &lt;br&gt;
wander the world without obligation. &lt;br&gt;
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! &lt;br&gt;
There will be those who understand!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings.
And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flung open are the doors to the deathless! &lt;br&gt;
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith. &lt;br&gt;
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach &lt;br&gt;
the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika,
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha,
“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha,
“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.
The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.
Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s long, mendicant.
It’s not easy to calculate
how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.
By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man is born &lt;br&gt;
with an axe in his mouth. &lt;br&gt;
A fool cuts themselves with it &lt;br&gt;
when they say bad words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you praise someone worthy of criticism, &lt;br&gt;
or criticize someone worthy of praise, &lt;br&gt;
you choose bad luck with your own mouth: &lt;br&gt;
you’ll never find happiness that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, &lt;br&gt;
if all you lose is your money &lt;br&gt;
and all you own, even yourself. &lt;br&gt;
What’s really terrible luck &lt;br&gt;
is to hate the holy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two quinquadecillion years, &lt;br&gt;
and another five quattuordecillion years, &lt;br&gt;
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, &lt;br&gt;
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.
There he addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā.
He had a capital named Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū.
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining
that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher.
Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī,
‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha:
“Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin!
Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder! &lt;br&gt;
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! &lt;br&gt;
Crush the army of Death, &lt;br&gt;
as an elephant a hut of reeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever will live diligently &lt;br&gt;
in this teaching and training, &lt;br&gt;
giving up transmigration through rebirths, &lt;br&gt;
will make an end of suffering.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe,
as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants,
‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We did, sir.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But what exactly did you hear?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This is what we heard, sir: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rouse yourselves! Try harder! &lt;br&gt;
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! &lt;br&gt;
Crush the army of Death, &lt;br&gt;
as an elephant a hut of reeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever will live heedfully &lt;br&gt;
in this teaching and training, &lt;br&gt;
giving up transmigration through rebirths, &lt;br&gt;
will make an end of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what we heard, sir.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Good, good, mendicants!
It’s good that you heard the mendicant Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a Brahmā realm.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the bank of the Sappinī river. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, lighting up the entire Sappinī riverbank, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The aristocrat is first among people  &lt;br&gt;
who take clan as the standard. &lt;br&gt;
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct &lt;br&gt;
is first among gods and humans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra said,
and the teacher approved.
Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One should frequent secluded lodgings, &lt;br&gt;
and practice to be released from fetters. &lt;br&gt;
If you don’t find enjoyment there, &lt;br&gt;
live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking for alms from family to family, &lt;br&gt;
with senses guarded, alert and mindful. &lt;br&gt;
One should frequent secluded lodgings, &lt;br&gt;
free of fear, freed in the fearless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where dreadful serpents slither, &lt;br&gt;
where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders &lt;br&gt;
in the dark of the night; &lt;br&gt;
there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this has in fact been seen by me, &lt;br&gt;
it isn’t just what the testament says. &lt;br&gt;
Within a single spiritual dispensation &lt;br&gt;
a thousand are destroyers of Death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of trainees there are more than five hundred, &lt;br&gt;
and ten times ten tens; &lt;br&gt;
all are stream-enterers, &lt;br&gt;
freed from rebirth in the animal realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for other people &lt;br&gt;
who I think have shared in merit—&lt;br&gt;
I couldn’t even number them, &lt;br&gt;
for fear of speaking falsely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on.
Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching.
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.
May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All Buddhas in the past, &lt;br&gt;
the Buddhas of the future, &lt;br&gt;
and the Buddha at present—&lt;br&gt;
destroyer of the sorrows of many—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respecting the true teaching &lt;br&gt;
they did live, they do live, &lt;br&gt;
and they also will live. &lt;br&gt;
This is the nature of the Buddhas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, &lt;br&gt;
and wants to become the very best they can be,&lt;br&gt;
should respect the true teaching, &lt;br&gt;
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit, &lt;br&gt;
as are the bamboo and the reed. &lt;br&gt;
Honor destroys a sinner, &lt;br&gt;
as pregnancy destroys a mule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all:
‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the Realized One’s last words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All creatures in this world &lt;br&gt;
must lay down this bag of bones. &lt;br&gt;
For even a Teacher such as this, &lt;br&gt;
unrivaled in the world, &lt;br&gt;
the Realized One, attained to power, &lt;br&gt;
the Buddha became fully extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, &lt;br&gt;
their nature is to rise and fall; &lt;br&gt;
having arisen, they cease; &lt;br&gt;
their stilling is true bliss.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there was terror! &lt;br&gt;
Then they had goosebumps! &lt;br&gt;
When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, &lt;br&gt;
became fully extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was no more breathing &lt;br&gt;
for the poised one of steady heart. &lt;br&gt;
Imperturbable, committed to peace, &lt;br&gt;
the seer became fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He put up with painful feelings &lt;br&gt;
without flinching. &lt;br&gt;
The liberation of his heart &lt;br&gt;
was like the extinguishing of a lamp.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on Brahmā are complete.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati thought,
“This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā.
Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam, &lt;br&gt;
to which you offer a regular oblation. &lt;br&gt;
But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food. &lt;br&gt;
Why make invocations, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Brahmadeva, madam, &lt;br&gt;
free of attachments, has surpassed the gods. &lt;br&gt;
Owning nothing, providing for no other, a mendicant &lt;br&gt;
has entered your house for alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, a knowledge master, self-developed. &lt;br&gt;
He’s worthy of a religious donation from gods and men. &lt;br&gt;
Having shunned all evils, he’s unsullied. &lt;br&gt;
Cool at heart, he wanders looking for food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has no before and after, &lt;br&gt;
peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope, &lt;br&gt;
he has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frail. &lt;br&gt;
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd, &lt;br&gt;
he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed. &lt;br&gt;
He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed. &lt;br&gt;
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unwavering confidence in him, &lt;br&gt;
present your religious donation to one who is worthy of it. &lt;br&gt;
Now that you’ve seen the sage who has crossed over, madam, &lt;br&gt;
make merit for the sake of future happiness!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unwavering confidence in him, &lt;br&gt;
she presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of it. &lt;br&gt;
After seeing the sage who had crossed over, the brahmin lady &lt;br&gt;
made merit for the sake of future happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:
“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to him,
“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,
“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!
Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.
And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that
there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.
And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers are now wielders of power, &lt;br&gt;
having passed beyond rebirth and old age. &lt;br&gt;
This is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge-master. &lt;br&gt;
And now many people pray to us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long, &lt;br&gt;
though you think it’s long. &lt;br&gt;
I know that your life span &lt;br&gt;
is two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision, &lt;br&gt;
who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
What precepts and observances did I practice in the past? &lt;br&gt;
Explain to me so I can understand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You gave drink to many people &lt;br&gt;
who were oppressed by thirst and heat. &lt;br&gt;
They’re the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. &lt;br&gt;
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people at Deer River Bank were seized, &lt;br&gt;
you released the captives as they were led away. &lt;br&gt;
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. &lt;br&gt;
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a boat on the Ganges River was seized &lt;br&gt;
by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh, &lt;br&gt;
you freed it wielding mighty force. &lt;br&gt;
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. &lt;br&gt;
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be your servant named Kappa. &lt;br&gt;
You thought he was intelligent and loyal. &lt;br&gt;
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. &lt;br&gt;
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You certainly understand this life span of mine. &lt;br&gt;
And others, too, you know; that’s why you’re the Buddha. &lt;br&gt;
And that’s why your blazing glory &lt;br&gt;
lights up even the Brahmā realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa,
“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha.
He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent.
Come, let’s go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them,
“Well now, good sirs, where have you come from?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good sir, we’ve come from the presence of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā,
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see that, good sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā,
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see that, good sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three hundreds of phoenixes, four of swans, and five of eagles. &lt;br&gt;
This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption. &lt;br&gt;
It shines, Brahmā, &lt;br&gt;
lighting up the northern quarter!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what if your palace shines, &lt;br&gt;
lighting up the northern quarter? &lt;br&gt;
A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form, &lt;br&gt;
its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after inspiring awe in that Brahmā, the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa vanished right there.
And after some time that Brahmā went to attend on the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:
“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,
“Where is the Buddha staying at present?”
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Mahākassapa …
positioned himself in the south … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venerable Mahākappina …
positioned himself in the west … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venerable Anuruddha …
positioned himself in the north, below the Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, do you still have the same view &lt;br&gt;
that you had in the past? &lt;br&gt;
Or do you see the radiance &lt;br&gt;
transcending the Brahmā realm?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good sir, I don’t have that view &lt;br&gt;
that I had in the past. &lt;br&gt;
I see the radiance &lt;br&gt;
transcending the Brahmā realm. &lt;br&gt;
So how could I say today &lt;br&gt;
that I am permanent and eternal?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue,
“Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him:
‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might
comparable to the masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, good sir,” replied that retinue member. He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s retinue in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many disciples of the Buddha &lt;br&gt;
who have the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
and have attained psychic power, expert in reading minds, &lt;br&gt;
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him,
“Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There are many disciples of the Buddha &lt;br&gt;
who have the three knowledges, &lt;br&gt;
and have attained psychic power, expert in reading minds, &lt;br&gt;
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what that member of Brahmā’s retinue said.
Satisfied, that Brahmā was happy with what the member of his retinue said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Suddhāvāsa recited this verse about the mendicant Katamorakatissaka in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What wise person here would judge &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Subrahmā recited this verse about the mendicant Kokālika in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What wise person here would judge &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the mendicant Kokālika was sick, suffering, gravely ill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, late at night, the beautiful independent brahmā Tudu, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the mendicant Kokālika, and standing in the air he said to him,
“Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they’re good monks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who are you, reverend?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am Tudu the independent brahmā.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Didn’t the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you doing back here?
See how far you have strayed!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man is born &lt;br&gt;
with an axe in his mouth. &lt;br&gt;
A fool cuts themselves with it &lt;br&gt;
when they say bad words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you praise someone worthy of criticism, &lt;br&gt;
or criticize someone worthy of praise, &lt;br&gt;
you choose bad luck with your own mouth: &lt;br&gt;
you’ll never find happiness that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, &lt;br&gt;
if all you lose is your money &lt;br&gt;
and all you own, even yourself. &lt;br&gt;
What’s really terrible luck &lt;br&gt;
is to hate the holy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two quinquadecillion years, &lt;br&gt;
and another five quattuordecillion years, &lt;br&gt;
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, &lt;br&gt;
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, develop immersion.
A mendicant who has immersion truly understands.
What do they truly understand?
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
Develop immersion.
A mendicant who has immersion truly understands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should practice meditation to understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” &lt;/p&gt;

Because those discussions aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you discuss, you should discuss: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. … &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth.
What two?
Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that middle way of practice?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is the noble truth of suffering.
Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.
It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is,
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.
‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …
‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve respects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve respects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge and vision arose in me:
‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña:
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry:
“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings …
the Gods of the Thirty-Three …
the Gods of Yama …
the Joyful Gods …
the Gods Who Love to Create …
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others …
the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry:
“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm.
And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
“Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”. &lt;/p&gt;

What four?
The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble truth of suffering?
You should say: ‘The five grasping aggregates’.
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
This is called the noble truth of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?
It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is,
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.
This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering?
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it.
This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
These are the four noble truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should practice meditation …” &lt;/p&gt;

Why is that?
It’s because they haven’t seen the four noble truths.
What four?
The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should practice meditation to understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on the Truths, the twelfth section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Book is finished. &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
The noble truths of suffering,
the origin of suffering,
the cessation of suffering,
and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of not truly seeing &lt;br&gt;
the four noble truths, &lt;br&gt;
we have transmigrated for a long time &lt;br&gt;
from one rebirth to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that these truths have been seen, &lt;br&gt;
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated. &lt;br&gt;
The root of suffering is cut off, &lt;br&gt;
now there’ll be no more future lives.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.

&lt;p&gt;“There are those who don’t understand suffering &lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they don’t know the path &lt;br&gt;
that leads to the stilling of suffering. &lt;br&gt;
They lack the heart’s release, &lt;br&gt;
as well as the release by wisdom. &lt;br&gt;
Unable to make an end, &lt;br&gt;
they continue to be reborn and grow old. &lt;/p&gt;

Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, does someone who sees suffering also see the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they said this, Venerable Gavampati said to those senior mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Someone who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
Someone who sees the origin of suffering also sees suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
Someone who sees the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.

Which is more:
the few leaves in my hand, or those in the forest above me?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, the few leaves in your hand are a tiny amount.
There are far more leaves in the forest above.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, there is much more that I have directly known but have not explained to you. What I have explained is a tiny amount.
And why haven’t I explained it?
Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
That’s why I haven’t explained it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what have I explained?
I have explained: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. &lt;/p&gt;

Because of the small size of those life-forms.

&lt;p&gt;But when the Realized One arises in the world, a great light, a great radiance appears.
Darkness no longer prevails.
Then there’s the explanation of the four noble truths, the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of them.
What four?
The noble truths of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should practice meditation …” &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world.
Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk.
When he saw this he thought,
‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind!
I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd,
‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind!
I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind?
And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world.
Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk.
That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind.
And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Well, mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind.
And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal.
Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.
The defeated and terrified demons entered the demon city through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mendicants, don’t speculate about the world.
For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
Why is that?
Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
Why is that?

&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Come, mendicants, let’s go to Inspiration Peak for the day’s meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” they replied.
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to Inspiration Peak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain mendicant saw the big cliff there
and said to the Buddha,
“Sir, that big cliff is really huge and scary.
Is there any other cliff bigger and scarier than this one?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is, mendicant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, what is it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicant, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
They take pleasure in choices that lead to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
Since they take pleasure in such choices, they continue to make them.
Having made choices that lead to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, they fall down the cliff of rebirth, old age, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They’re not freed from suffering, I say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery. They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he saw this he thought,
“These Licchavi youths really are trained, so well trained,
in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Ānanda?
Which is harder and more challenging:
to shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing? Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s more difficult and challenging, sir, to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Still, Ānanda, those who truly penetrate suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path penetrate something tougher than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should practice meditation …” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There the Buddha … said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of alms-food. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, the layman named Kakkaṭa has passed away in Nādika.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?
The laymen named Kaḷibha,
Nikata,
Kaṭissaha,
Tuṭṭha,
Santuṭṭha,
Bhadda, and
Subhadda have passed away in Nādika.
Where have they been reborn in the next life?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, the laymen Kakkaṭa,
Kaḷibha,
Nikata,
Kaṭissaha,
Tuṭṭha,
Santuṭṭha,
Bhadda,
and Subhadda passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over fifty laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ninety laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In excess of five hundred laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away.
But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that would be a bother for me.
So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that mirror of the teaching? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
This is that mirror of the teaching.

“Mendicants, the brahmins advocate a practice called ‘get up and go’.
They encourage their disciples:
‘Please, good people, rising early you should face east and walk.
Do not avoid a pit, a cliff, a stump, thorny ground, a swamp, or a sewer.
You should await death in the place that you fall.
And when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heaven realm.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this practice of the brahmins is a foolish procedure, a stupid procedure. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, or extinguishment.
But in the training of the Noble One I advocate a ‘get up and go’ practice
which does lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that ‘get up and go’ practice?

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, how many things do people have to give up and how many do they have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, people have to give up four things and possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
They don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And they do have the experiential confidence in the Buddha that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm.
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And they do have the experiential confidence in the teaching that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm.
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And they do have the experiential confidence in the Saṅgha that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm.
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And they do have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm.
Their ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
People have to give up these four things and possess these four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous and full of people, with cramped cul-de-sacs.
In the late afternoon, after paying homage to the Buddha or an esteemed mendicant, I enter Kapilavatthu.
I encounter a stray elephant,
horse,
chariot,
cart,
or person.
At that time I lose mindfulness regarding the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
I think:
‘If I were to die at this time, where would I be reborn in my next life?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not fear, Mahānāma, do not fear!
Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one.
Take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Their body consists of form, made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.
Right here the crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures devour it.
But their mind rises up, headed for a higher place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a person was to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open.
Its shards and chips would sink down, while the ghee or oil in it would rise up, headed for a higher place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.

&lt;p&gt;Then Mahānāma and Godhā went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahānāma told the Buddha all that had happened, and then said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   “Sir, some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks the other.
I’d side with the Buddha.
May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence.
Some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns the other. …
The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns and the laymen the other. …
The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns and the laymen and the laywomen the other. …
The Buddha might take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns and the laymen and the laywomen and the world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the other.
I’d side with the Buddha.
May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Godhā, what do you have to say to Mahānāma when he speaks like this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I have nothing to say to Mahānāma when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away.
The Buddha declared that he was
a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and objecting,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
Who can’t become a stream-enterer these days?
For the Buddha even declared Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away.
Sarakāni was too weak for the training; he used to drink alcohol.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how could they go to the underworld?
And if anyone should rightly be said to
have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, it’s Sarakāni the Sakyan.
Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
How could he go to the underworld? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom.
They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom.
With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom.
With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom.
With the ending of three fetters they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.
This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom.
Still, they have these qualities:
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
And they accept the principles proclaimed by the Realized One after considering them with a degree of wisdom.
This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these great sal trees could understand what was well said and poorly said, I’d declare them to be stream-enterers.

Sarakāni didn’t fulfill the training.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a barren field, a barren ground, with uncleared stumps. And you had seeds that were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged, infertile, and ill kept. And the heavens didn’t provide enough rain.
Would those seeds grow, increase, and mature?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, take a teaching that’s badly explained and badly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.
This is what I call a barren field.
A disciple remains in such a teaching, practicing in line with that teaching, practicing it properly, living in line with that teaching.
This is what I call a bad seed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sāriputta consented in silence. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“Householder, I hope you’re coping; I hope you’re getting better. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, you don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the teaching, that pain may die down on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And you have experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the teaching, that pain may die down on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And you have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms. It is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the Saṅgha, that pain may die down on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Your ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
Seeing in yourself that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, that pain may die down on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have the wrong view that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
You have right view.
Seeing in yourself that right view, that pain may die down on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have the wrong thought … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong speech … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong action … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong livelihood … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong effort … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong mindfulness … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong immersion … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong knowledge … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong freedom …
You have right freedom.
Seeing in yourself that right freedom, that pain may die down on the spot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Anāthapiṇḍika’s pain died down on the spot.
Then he served Sāriputta and Ānanda from his own dish.
When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika took a low seat and sat to one side.
Venerable Sāriputta expressed his appreciation to him with these verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever has faith in the Realized One, &lt;br&gt;
unwavering and well grounded; &lt;br&gt;
whose ethical conduct is good, &lt;br&gt;
praised and loved by the noble ones; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who has confidence in the Saṅgha, &lt;br&gt;
and correct view: &lt;br&gt;
they’re said to be prosperous, &lt;br&gt;
their life is not in vain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let the wise devote themselves &lt;br&gt;
to faith, ethical behaviour, &lt;br&gt;
confidence, and insight into the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After expressing his appreciation to Anāthapiṇḍika with these verses, Sāriputta got up from his seat and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“So, Ānanda, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta advised the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in this way and that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sāriputta is astute, Ānanda.
He has great wisdom, since he can analyze the four factors of stream-entry in ten respects.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled?
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness.
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.
Anyone who steals …
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct …
Anyone who lies …
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness.
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom?
A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.’ That is:
Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked.
Ānanda consented in silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika. He sat down on the seat spread out and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“Householder, I hope you’re coping; I hope you’re getting better. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing; that its fading, not its growing, is apparent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, when an uneducated ordinary person has four things, they’re frightened and terrified, and fear what awaits them after death.
What four?

“Mendicants, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Nandaka the Licchavi minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nandaka, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.
What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A noble disciple who has these four things is guaranteed long life,
beauty,
happiness,
fame,
and sovereignty, both human and divine.
Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, a certain person said to Nandaka: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, it is time to bathe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enough now, my man, with that exterior bath.
This interior bathing will do for me, that is,
confidence in the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the lay follower Dhīgāvu was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed his father, the householder Jotika,
“Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the lay follower Dhīgāvu is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, dear,” replied Jotika. He did as Dīghāvu asked.
The Buddha consented in silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him,
“I hope you’re coping, Dīghāvu; I hope you’re getting better. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this:
‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I am seen in them.
For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And I have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization.
You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation.
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I embody them.
For I meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, sir, I think,
‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer grief when I’ve gone.’”
Jotika said, “Dear Dīghāvu, don’t focus on that.
Come on, dear Dīghāvu, you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left.
Not long after the Buddha left, Dīghāvu passed away.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, the lay follower named Dīghāvu, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, the lay follower Dīghāvu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.
With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously, and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” Nandiya replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And how does a noble disciple live negligently?
Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
They’re content with that confidence, and don’t make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night.
When they live negligently, there’s no joy.
When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture.
When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility.
When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering.
When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear.
Because principles have not become clear, they’re reckoned to live negligently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
They’re content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, and don’t make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night.
When they live negligently, there’s no joy.
When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture.
When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility.
When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering.
When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear.
Because principles have not become clear, they’re reckoned to live negligently.
That’s how a noble disciple lives negligently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a noble disciple live diligently?
Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
But they’re not content with that confidence, and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night.
When they live diligently, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is immersed in samādhi, principles become clear.
Because principles have become clear, they’re reckoned to live diligently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
But they’re not content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night.
When they live diligently, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is immersed in samādhi, principles become clear.
Because principles have become clear, they’re reckoned to live diligently.
That’s how a noble disciple lives diligently.” &lt;/p&gt;

What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the teaching …
the Saṅgha … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is the fourth kind of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness.
These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurture happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to measure how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places where the great rivers—the Ganges, Yamuna, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—come together and converge.
It’s not easy measure how much water is in such places by saying
how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to measure how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hosts of people use the rivers, &lt;br&gt;
and though the rivers are many, &lt;br&gt;
all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean, &lt;br&gt;
the cruel sea that’s home to precious gems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes; &lt;br&gt;
and they’re a giver of beds, seats, and mats—&lt;br&gt;
the streams of merit reach that astute person, &lt;br&gt;
as the rivers bring their waters to the sea.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, how many things do people have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, people have to possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;

‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
Then they’re considered to be a faithful lay follower.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Sāriputta!
For anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever has faith in the Realized One, &lt;br&gt;
unwavering and well grounded; &lt;br&gt;
whose ethical conduct is good, &lt;br&gt;
praised and loved by the noble ones; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who has confidence in the Saṅgha, &lt;br&gt;
and correct view: &lt;br&gt;
they’re said to be prosperous, &lt;br&gt;
their life is not in vain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let the wise devote themselves &lt;br&gt;
to faith, ethical behaviour, &lt;br&gt;
confidence, and insight into the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now at that time a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Sāvatthī arrived at Kapilavatthu on some business.
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard about this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went to that mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, we hope that you’re healthy and well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am, good sirs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we hope that Sāriputta and Moggallāna are healthy and well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, during this rains residence did you hear and learn anything in the presence of the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good sirs, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘There are fewer mendicants who realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
There are more mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘There are fewer mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.
There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘There are fewer mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this.
Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him that he had heard that the Buddha was leaving. He added,
“Sir, I haven’t heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha
how a wise lay follower should advise another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mahānāma, a wise lay follower should put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with four consolations.
‘Be at ease, sir.
You have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And you have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with these four consolations, they should say:
‘Are you concerned for your mother and father?’
If they reply,
‘I am,’ they should say:
‘But sir, it’s your nature to die.
Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father,
you will die anyway.
It would be good to give up concern for your mother and father.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they reply,
‘I have given up concern for my mother and father,’ they should say:
‘But are you concerned for your partners and children?’
If they reply,
‘I am,’ they should say:
‘But sir, it’s your nature to die.
Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children,
you will die anyway.
It would be good to give up concern for your partners and children.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they reply,
‘I have given up concern for my partners and children,’ they should say:
‘But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation?’
If they reply,
‘I am,’ they should say:
‘Good sir, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures.
It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they reply,
‘I have done so,’ they should say:
‘Good sir, the gods of the Thirty-Three are better than the gods of the Four Great Kings … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Good sir, the gods of Yama …
the Joyful Gods …
the Gods Who Love to Create …
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others …
the Gods of the Brahmā realm are better than the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others and fix it on the Gods of the Brahmā realm.’
If they reply,
‘I have done so,’ they should say:
‘Good sir, the Brahmā realm is impermanent, not lasting, and included within identity.
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Brahmā realm and apply it to the cessation of identity.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they reply,
‘I have done so,’
then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements; that is,
between the freedom of one and the other.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then the lay follower Dhammadinna, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“May the Buddha please advise
and instruct us. It will be for our lasting welfare and happiness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this:
‘From time to time we will undertake and dwell upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.’
That’s how you should train yourselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, we live at home with our children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money.
It’s not easy for us to undertake and dwell from time to time upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.
Since we are established in the five training rules, please teach us further.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this:
‘We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And we will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’
That’s how you should train yourselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in us, and we embody them.
For we have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And we have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re fortunate, Dhammadinna, so very fortunate!
You have all declared the fruit of stream-entry.” &lt;/p&gt;

At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.
Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business.
They heard about this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they posted someone on the road, saying: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”
And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.
When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming.
Please come at your convenience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him.
And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out.
The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, when we hear that
you will be setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that
you will be far from us.
And when we hear that
you are setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that
you are far from us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we hear that
you will be setting out from the Kosalan lands to wander in the Mallian lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that
you will be far from us.
And when we hear that
you are setting out from the Kosalan lands to wander in the Mallian lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that
you are far from us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we hear that
you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to wander in the Vajjian lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the Kāsian lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Māgadhan lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you are setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Māgadhan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that
you are far from us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we hear that
you will be setting out from the Māgadhan lands to wander in the Kāsian lands, we’re happy and joyful, thinking that
you will be near to us.
And when we hear that
you are setting out from the Māgadhan lands to wander in the Kāsian lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the Vajjian lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the Mallian lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to wander in the Kosalan lands … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; you will be setting out in the Kosalan lands to wander to Sāvatthī, we’re happy and joyful, thinking that
you will be near to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we hear that
you are staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery we have no little happiness and joy, thinking that
you are near to us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
Just this much is enough to be diligent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, for us there is something that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind.
Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on.
The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are.
Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and ourselves.
But we don’t recall having a bad thought regarding those sisters.
This is that thing that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
Just this much is enough to be diligent.
A noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
They live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And whatever there is in your family that’s available to give, you share it all with those who are ethical, of good character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chamberlains?
How many people among the Kosalans are your equal
when it comes to giving and sharing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re fortunate, sir, so very fortunate,
in that the Buddha understands us like this.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate.
The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes.
We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain.
Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that.
But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either.
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’
Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures.
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that.
But if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either.
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’
Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves. And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of stealing.
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it.
But if I were to have sexual relations with someone else’s wives, he wouldn’t like that either.
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’
Reflecting in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of sexual misconduct.
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to distort my meaning by lying, I wouldn’t like it.
But if I were to distort someone else’s meaning by lying, they wouldn’t like it either.
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’
Reflecting in this way, they give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying, praising the giving up of lying.
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn’t like it.
But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to attack me with harsh speech, I wouldn’t like it.
But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn’t like it.
But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn’t like it either.’
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?’
Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving up of talking nonsense.
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?
The nun named Nandā,
the layman named Sudatta,
and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away.
Where have they been reborn in the next life?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away.
But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me.
So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that mirror of the teaching? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …
the teaching …
the Saṅgha …
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.
This is that mirror of the teaching.
A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The following two discourses have the same setting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when one thing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.
What one thing?
Mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing mental processes.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood.
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila,
“Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Kimbila kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a third time, the Buddha said to him,
“How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?”
And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?
It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Why is that?
Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say.
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Why is that?
Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say.
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’

At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Why is that?
Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say.
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’

They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity.
Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads.
And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east,
west,
north,
or south and destroy that heap of sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body,
feelings,
mind,
or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.” &lt;/p&gt;

“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months.
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my alms-food.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the alms-food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you:
‘Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?’ You should answer them like this.
‘Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When breathing in heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’

&lt;p&gt;I know: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if anything should be rightly called
‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’,
it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness. &lt;/p&gt;

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Mahānāma, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same;
they are different.
Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances.
What five?
The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will,
dullness and drowsiness,
restlessness and remorse,
and doubt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are trainee mendicants … meditate after giving up the five hindrances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements … for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root … and unable to arise in the future.
And here’s another way to understand how
the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
There he addressed the mendicants,
‘Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months.
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my alms-food.’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is, Ānanda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, what is that one thing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?
It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ …

…
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Why is that?
Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say.

They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind …
immersing the mind in samādhi …
freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence …
fading away …
cessation …
letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’
At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity.

&lt;p&gt;And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors?
Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body,
their mindfulness is established and lucid.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles,
their mindfulness is established and lucid.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This should be told in full as for the first kind of mindfulness meditation.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi.
At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it.
That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom?
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,
investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;

investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’ve given up desire for sensual pleasures of the past. I’m rid of desire for sensual pleasures of the future. And I have eliminated perception of repulsion regarding phenomena internally and externally.

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when an immersion has been developed and cultivated there’s no motion or trembling of the body or mind. That mendicant gets such immersion when he wants, without trouble or difficulty.
And what is that immersion? &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight.
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my alms-food.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the alms-food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those mendicants thought,
“The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness.
Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists.
Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,
“Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said,
“Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant Saṅgha to get enlightened.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said,
“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled.
Please, sir, come at your convenience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.
And how is it so developed and cultivated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.” &lt;/p&gt;

How so? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ …
They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’
That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation.
And while I was usually practicing this kind of meditation neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued.
And my mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And may my mind be freed from grasping without defilements.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I give up memories and thoughts of the lay life.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, may I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, may I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘With the fading away of rapture, may I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, may I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that “consciousness is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that “there is nothing at all”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, may I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a mendicant might wish:
‘Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, may I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.’
So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, there are these four absorptions.
What four? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the four absorptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be expanded for each of the different rivers as in SN 45.91–102.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six on slanting to the east, &lt;br&gt;
and six on slanting to the ocean; &lt;br&gt;
these two sixes make twelve, &lt;br&gt;
and that’s how this chapter is recited.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever has missed out on these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.
Whoever has undertaken these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna knew what Venerable Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Anuruddha,
and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Anuruddha, how do you define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, it’s when a mendicant meditates observing the body internally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing the body externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing the body internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing feelings internally …
externally …
internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing the mind internally …
externally …
internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing principles internally …
externally …
internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. …
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, ignoring both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how to define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever has missed out on these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.
Whoever has undertaken these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna knew what Venerable Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Anuruddha and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Anuruddha, how do you define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, it’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of the body externally …
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally …
externally …
internally and externally … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally …
externally …
internally and externally … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of principles internally …
externally …
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how to define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant.” &lt;/p&gt;

There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east,
a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying:
‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’
What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, reverend.
Why is that?
The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west.
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying:
‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you?
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life.
Why is that?
Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?

Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Anuruddha, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Anuruddha, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.
What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These days, reverend, I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
What four?
I meditate observing an aspect of the body …
feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
These days I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—usually meditates with their mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re so fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate,
to have heard such a dramatic statement in the presence of Venerable Anuruddha.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:
“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.
Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
He didn’t beg the Buddha,
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time …
and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
He didn’t beg the Buddha,
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to him,
“Go now, Ānanda,
at your convenience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today you do have such monk disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today you do have such nun disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples …
and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today you do have such layman
and laywoman disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’
Today your spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,
“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.
Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.
When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life, &lt;br&gt;
the sage surrendered the life force. &lt;br&gt;
Happy inside, serene, &lt;br&gt;
he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And they meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,
“These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties.
Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe.
Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wanting to strike awe in you, the mendicant Moggallāna made the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, mendicants?
What things has the mendicant Moggallāna developed and cultivated so as to have such power and might?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, mendicants, listen.
The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power.
What four?
Moggallāna develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm …
energy …
mental development …
inquiry, and active effort.
He thinks: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’
And he meditates perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;
as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, he develops a mind that’s full of radiance.
The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the mendicant Moggallāna wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the mendicant Moggallāna realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason for the development of the bases of psychic power?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.
They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.”
And they meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;
as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mental development … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inquiry, and active effort.
They think: “My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.”
And they meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;
as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.
They understand mind with hate …
mind without hate …
mind with delusion …
mind without delusion …
constricted mind …
scattered mind …
expansive mind …
unexpansive mind …
mind that is not supreme …
mind that is supreme …
mind immersed in samādhi …
mind not immersed in samādhi …
freed mind …
They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him,
“Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that path?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm …
energy …
mental development …
inquiry, and active effort.
This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite.
For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, brahmin?
Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away.
They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away.
They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away.
They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away.
What do you think, brahmin?
This being the case, is the path endless or finite?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless.
Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

It’s when a mendicant wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
This is called psychic power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the basis of psychic power?
The path and practice that leads to gaining psychic power.

&lt;p&gt;And what is the development of the bases of psychic power?

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘What’s the path and practice for developing the bases of psychic power?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.
They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.”
And they meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;
as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. &lt;/p&gt;

And they meditate perceiving continuity:

as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a mendicant wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The six direct knowledges should also be expanded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How so?
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.
They think: ‘My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’
And they meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before;
as below, so above; as above, so below;
as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.

as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is enthusiasm that’s too lax?
It’s when enthusiasm is combined with laziness.
This is called lax enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is enthusiasm that’s too tense?
It’s when enthusiasm is combined with restlessness.
This is called tense enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is enthusiasm that’s constricted internally?
It’s when enthusiasm is combined with dullness and drowsiness.
This is called enthusiasm constricted internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is enthusiasm that’s distracted externally?
It’s when enthusiasm is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
This is called enthusiasm distracted externally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant meditate perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before?
It’s when the perception of continuity is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant.
That’s how a mendicant meditates perceiving continuity:
as before, so after; as after, so before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant meditate as below, so above; as above, so below?
It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
That’s how a mendicant meditates as below, so above; as above, so below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant meditate as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day?
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort, with the same features, attributes, and signs by day as by night.
And they develop it with the same features, attributes, and signs by night as by day.
That’s how a mendicant meditates as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how, with an open and unenveloped heart, does a mendicant develop a mind that’s full of radiance?
It’s when a mendicant has properly grasped the perception of light, and has properly grasped the perception of day.
That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is energy that’s too lax? … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is mental development that’s too lax? … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is inquiry that’s too lax?
It’s when inquiry is combined with laziness.
This is called lax inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is inquiry that’s too tense?
It’s when inquiry is combined with restlessness.
This is called tense inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is inquiry that’s constricted internally?
It’s when inquiry is combined with dullness and drowsiness.
This is called inquiry constricted internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is inquiry that’s distracted externally?
It’s when inquiry is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
This is called inquiry distracted externally. …
That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance.

&lt;p&gt;“But do you have personal experience of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do, Ānanda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible and amazing that the Buddha is capable of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with a mind-made body! And that he has personal experience of going to the Brahmā realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, the Realized Ones are incredible and have incredible qualities. They’re amazing and have amazing qualities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the Realized One submerges his body in his mind and his mind in his body. He meditates after sinking into a perception of bliss and lightness in the body.
At that time his body becomes lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was an iron ball that had been heated all day. It’d become lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant.

At that time his body easily rises up from the ground into the air.

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a light tuft of cotton-wool or kapok. Taken up by the wind, it would easily rise up from the ground into the air.

enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” &lt;/p&gt;

If not, they attain enlightenment at the time of death.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next … they’re extinguished upon landing … they’re extinguished without extra effort … they’re extinguished with extra effort … they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm.

&lt;p&gt;These five powers should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher fetters.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be expanded as in SN 45.171–179, with the above as the final discourse.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floods, bonds, grasping, &lt;br&gt;
ties, and underlying tendencies, &lt;br&gt;
kinds of sensual stimulation, hindrances, &lt;br&gt;
aggregates, and fetters high and low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on the Powers is the sixth section.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from alms-round, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no escape in the world, &lt;br&gt;
so what will seclusion do for you? &lt;br&gt;
Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure; &lt;br&gt;
don’t regret it later.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Āḷavikā thought,
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she thought,
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from seclusion!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is an escape in the world, &lt;br&gt;
and I’ve personally experienced it with wisdom. &lt;br&gt;
O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent, &lt;br&gt;
you don’t know that place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes; &lt;br&gt;
the aggregates are their chopping block. &lt;br&gt;
What you call sensual delight &lt;br&gt;
has become no delight for me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Āḷavikā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Vajirā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from alms-round, she went to the Dark Forest,
plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Vajirā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who created this sentient being? &lt;br&gt;
Where is its maker? &lt;br&gt;
Where has the being arisen? &lt;br&gt;
And where does it cease?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Vajirā thought,
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she thought,
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Vajirā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a ‘sentient being’? &lt;br&gt;
Māra, is this your theory? &lt;br&gt;
This is just a pile of conditions, &lt;br&gt;
you won’t find a sentient being here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the parts are assembled &lt;br&gt;
we use the word ‘chariot’. &lt;br&gt;
So too, when the aggregates are present &lt;br&gt;
‘sentient being’ is the convention we use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s only suffering that comes to be, &lt;br&gt;
lasts a while, then disappears. &lt;br&gt;
Naught but suffering comes to be, &lt;br&gt;
naught but suffering ceases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Vajirā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That state’s very challenging; &lt;br&gt;
it’s for the sages to attain. &lt;br&gt;
It’s not possible for a woman, &lt;br&gt;
with her two-fingered wisdom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Somā thought,
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she thought,
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Somā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What difference does womanhood make &lt;br&gt;
when the mind is serene, &lt;br&gt;
and knowledge is present &lt;br&gt;
as you rightly discern the Dhamma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely someone who might think: &lt;br&gt;
‘I am woman’, or ‘I am man’, &lt;br&gt;
or ‘I am’ anything at all, &lt;br&gt;
is fit for Māra to address.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do you sit alone and cry &lt;br&gt;
as if your children have died? &lt;br&gt;
You’ve come to the woods all alone—&lt;br&gt;
you must be looking for a man!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Kisāgotamī thought,

I don’t grieve or lament, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relishing is destroyed in every respect, &lt;br&gt;

I’ve defeated the army of death, &lt;br&gt;

I’m horrified and repelled by it, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll vanish, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you approve of rebirth? &lt;br&gt;
When you’re born, you get to enjoy sensual pleasures. &lt;br&gt;
Who put this idea in your head: &lt;br&gt;
‘Nun, don’t approve of rebirth’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Death comes to those who are born, &lt;br&gt;
when you’re born you undergo sufferings—&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In whose name did you shave your head? &lt;br&gt;
You look like an ascetic, &lt;br&gt;
but you don’t believe in any creed. &lt;br&gt;
Why do you live as if lost?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Followers of other creeds &lt;br&gt;
are confident in their views. &lt;br&gt;
But I don’t believe in their teaching, &lt;br&gt;
for they’re no experts in the Dhamma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one born in the Sakyan clan, &lt;br&gt;
the unrivaled Buddha, &lt;br&gt;
champion, dispeller of Māra, &lt;br&gt;
everywhere undefeated, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everywhere freed, and unattached, &lt;br&gt;
the all-seeing seer. &lt;br&gt;
He has attained the end of all deeds, &lt;br&gt;
freed with the ending of attachments. &lt;br&gt;
That Blessed One is my Teacher, &lt;br&gt;
and I believe in his instruction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Sīsupacālā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Selā robed up in the morning …
and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Selā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps …
addressed her in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who created this puppet? &lt;br&gt;
Where is its maker? &lt;br&gt;
Where has the puppet arisen? &lt;br&gt;
And where does it cease?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the nun Selā thought,
“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she thought,
“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Selā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This puppet isn’t self-made, &lt;br&gt;
nor is this misery made by another. &lt;br&gt;
It comes to be because of a cause, &lt;br&gt;
and ceases when the cause breaks up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a seed that’s sown &lt;br&gt;
in a field; it grows &lt;br&gt;
relying on both the soil’s nutrients &lt;br&gt;
as well as moisture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way the aggregates and elements &lt;br&gt;
and these six sense fields &lt;br&gt;
come to be because of a cause, &lt;br&gt;
and cease when the cause breaks up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Selā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There the Buddha said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, there are these four right efforts.
What four? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.
These are the four right efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four right efforts slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant who develops the four right efforts slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four right efforts slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be expanded as in SN 45.92–102.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six on slanting to the east, &lt;br&gt;
and six on slanting to the ocean; &lt;br&gt;
these two sixes make twelve, &lt;br&gt;
and that’s how this chapter is recited.&lt;/p&gt;

What five?
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of faith?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This is called the faculty of faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of energy?
It’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.
This is called the faculty of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of mindfulness?
It’s when a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
This is called the faculty of mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of immersion?
It’s when a noble disciple, relying on letting go, gains immersion, gains unification of mind.
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is called the faculty of immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of wisdom?
It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is called the faculty of wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five faculties.” &lt;/p&gt;

What five?
The faculties of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, and equanimity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of pleasure arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
When in a state of pleasure, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of pleasure.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, you understand that the corresponding faculty of pleasure ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of pain arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
When in a state of pain, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of pain.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, you understand that the corresponding faculty of pain ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of happiness arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as happiness.
When in a state of happiness, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of happiness.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as happiness, you understand that the corresponding faculty of happiness ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of sadness arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as sadness.
When in a state of sadness, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of sadness.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as sadness, you understand that the corresponding faculty of sadness ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of equanimity arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as equanimous.
When in a state of equanimity, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of equanimity.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as equanimous, you understand that the corresponding faculty of equanimity ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the faculty of pleasure arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
When in a state of pleasure, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of pleasure.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, you understand that the corresponding faculty of pleasure ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faculty of pain …
happiness …
sadness …
equanimity arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as equanimous.
When in a state of equanimity, you understand: ‘I’m in a state of equanimity.’
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as equanimous, you understand that the corresponding faculty of equanimity ceases and stops.” &lt;/p&gt;

What five?
The faculties of pain, sadness, pleasure, happiness, and equanimity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of pain arises.
They understand:
‘The faculty of pain has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason.
It’s not possible for the faculty of pain to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’
They understand the faculty of pain, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of pain that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
And where does that faculty of pain that’s arisen cease without anything left over?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
That’s where the faculty of pain that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of pain, and who applies their mind to that end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of sadness arises.
They understand:
‘The faculty of sadness has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason.
It’s not possible for the faculty of sadness to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’
They understand the faculty of sadness, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of sadness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
And where does that faculty of sadness that’s arisen cease without anything left over?
It’s when, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
That’s where the faculty of sadness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of sadness, and who applies their mind to that end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of pleasure arises.
They understand:
‘The faculty of pleasure has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason.
it’s not possible for the faculty of pleasure to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’
They understand the faculty of pleasure, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of pleasure that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
And where does that faculty of pleasure that’s arisen cease without anything left over?
It’s when, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
That’s where the faculty of pleasure that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of pleasure, and who applies their mind to that end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of happiness arises.
They understand:
‘The faculty of happiness has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason.
it’s not possible for the faculty of happiness to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’
They understand the faculty of happiness, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of happiness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
And where does that faculty of happiness that’s arisen cease without anything left over?
It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
That’s where the faculty of happiness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of happiness, and who applies their mind to that end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of equanimity arises.
They understand:
‘The faculty of equanimity has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason.
It’s not possible for the faculty of equanimity to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’
They understand the faculty of equanimity, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of equanimity that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
And where does that faculty of equanimity that’s arisen cease without anything left over?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.
That’s where the faculty of equanimity that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.
They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of equanimity, and who applies their mind to that end.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat warming his back in the last rays of the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and while massaging the Buddha’s limbs he said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright. Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and your body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties
of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s how it is, Ānanda.
When young you’re liable to grow old; when healthy you’re liable to get sick; and when alive you’re liable to die.
The complexion of the skin is no longer pure and bright. The limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and the body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in the faculties
of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Curse this wretched old age, &lt;br&gt;
which makes you so ugly. &lt;br&gt;
That’s how much this delightful puppet &lt;br&gt;
is ground down by old age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you live for a hundred years, &lt;br&gt;
you’ll still end up dying. &lt;br&gt;
Death spares no-one, &lt;br&gt;
but crushes all underfoot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range.
What five?
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.
What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range.
What five?
The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.
These five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But Master Gotama, what does the mind have recourse to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mind has recourse to mindfulness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does mindfulness have recourse to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mindfulness has recourse to freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does freedom have recourse to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Freedom has recourse to extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does extinguishment have recourse to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning.
For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the western wall, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer part at the Añjana Wood.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, is there a way in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, there is a way in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that method?
The faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith.
The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy.
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness.
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion.
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that there was a river slanting, sloping, and inclining to the east, and in the middle was an island.
There’s a way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream.
But there’s also a way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream?
By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island,
that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams?
By taking into account the water to the north and the south of the island,
that river can be reckoned to have two streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith.
The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy.
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness.
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion.
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because of developing and cultivating the five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, how many faculties must a mendicant develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A mendicant must develop and cultivate one faculty so that they can declare enlightenment.
What one? The faculty of wisdom. When a noble disciple has wisdom, the faith, energy, mindfulness, and immersion that follow along with that become stabilized.
This is the one faculty that a mendicant must develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment:

the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, when developed and cultivated, culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.
There are those who have not known or seen or understood or realized or experienced this with wisdom. They may rely on faith in this matter.

Such a mendicant is called a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had declared enlightenment:
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  “What reason does Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja see for doing this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s because Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja has developed and cultivated three faculties that he declares enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What three?
The faculties of mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja has developed and cultivated these three faculties that he declares enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the culmination of these three faculties?
They culminate in ending.
In the ending of what?
Of rebirth, old age, and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because he sees that they culminate in the ending of rebirth, old age, and death that Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja declares enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town called Āpaṇa.
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sāriputta, would a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One have any doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect that a faithful noble disciple will live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
For their energy is the faculty of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect that a faithful and energetic noble disciple will be mindful, with utmost mindfulness and alertness, able to remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
For their mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect that a faithful, energetic, and mindful noble disciple will, relying on letting go, gain immersion, gain unification of mind.
For their samādhi is the faculty of immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect that a faithful, energetic, mindful noble disciple with their mind immersed in samādhi will understand this:
‘Transmigration has no known beginning.
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.
But when that dark mass of ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, that state is peaceful and sublime.
That is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’
For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a noble disciple has tried again and again, recollected again and again, entered immersion again and again, and understood with wisdom again and again, they will be confident of this:
‘I have previously heard of these things.
But now I have direct meditative experience of them, and see them with penetrating wisdom.’
For their faith is the faculty of faith.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Sāriputta! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sāriputta, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Buddha then repeated Sāriputta’s answer word for word.) &lt;/p&gt;

In the same way, the faculty of wisdom is said to be the best of the qualities that lead to awakening in terms of becoming awakened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the qualities that lead to awakening?
The faculties of faith,

mindfulness,

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, as long as noble knowledge hasn’t arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed.
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just like in a bungalow. As long as the roof peak is not lifted into place, the rafters are not stable or fixed.
But when the roof peak is lifted into place, the rafters become stable and fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, as long as noble knowledge hasn’t arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed.
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, and immersion.

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee? And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee, and that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee?
It’s when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee reflects:
‘Is there any other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha?’
They understand:
‘There is no other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha.’
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties:
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
And although they don’t have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination,
they do see them with penetrating wisdom.
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept?
It’s when a mendicant who is an adept understands the five faculties:
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
They have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination,
and they see them with penetrating wisdom.
This is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant who is an adept understands the six faculties:
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
They understand: ‘These six faculties will totally and utterly cease without anything left over. And no other six faculties will arise anywhere anyhow.’
This too is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.
What five?
The faculties of faith,
energy,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom.
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.
What five?
The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, sir, I lived the spiritual life under the fully awakened Buddha Kassapa.
There they knew me as
the mendicant Sahaka.
Because of developing and cultivating these same five faculties I lost desire for sensual pleasures. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, in the Brahmā realm.
There they know me as
Brahmā Sahampati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
I know and see how when these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Sāriputta!
For it is considering the supreme sanctuary that a mendicant whose defilements are ended, while still alive, continues to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that supreme sanctuary?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s when a mendicant with defilements ended develops the faculties of faith,
energy,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom, which lead to peace and awakening.

&lt;p&gt;“It’s when a mendicant with defilements ended maintains respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion.

&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of faith?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This is called the faculty of faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of energy?
It’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
This is called the faculty of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of mindfulness?
It’s when a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
This is called the faculty of mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of immersion?
It’s when a noble disciple, relying on letting go, gains immersion, gains unification of mind.
This is called the faculty of immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the faculty of wisdom?
It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
This is called the faculty of wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five faculties.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Wood.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
What four? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. &lt;/p&gt;

At that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
And the novice Cunda was his carer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness.
Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.
This is his bowl and robe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, this novice Cunda says that
Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.
This is his bowl and robe.
Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir, he did not.
But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions.
I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that
we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off.
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters!
Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to
realize a higher distinction than they had before.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!
Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to
realize a higher distinction than they had before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered.
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation.
As they do so, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
Then they reflect:
‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind.
Let me now pull back.’
They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.
They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered.
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation.
As they do so, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
Then they reflect:
‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind.
Let me now pull back.’
They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.
They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’
That’s how there is directed development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is there undirected development?
Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’
And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’
And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’
Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’
And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’

And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’
That’s how there is undirected development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development.
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said. &lt;/p&gt;

Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying:
‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that
I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present,
what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present,
still I understand this by inference from the teaching.
Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate.
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.
As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out.
He thinks,
‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching:
‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Sāriputta!
So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.” &lt;/p&gt;

How is a great man defined?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sāriputta, someone whose mind is free is a great man, I say.
If their mind is not free, I say they’re not a great man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does someone have a free mind?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed from the defilements by not grasping.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed from the defilements by not grasping.

It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished.
Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished.
When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed.
The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than
Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples
that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One
that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament.
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branches fell off.
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mendicants, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Bāhiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Well purified ethics and correct view.
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
Meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
When you develop these four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Venerable Bāhiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Bāhiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Bāhiya became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Uttiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Well purified ethics and correct view.
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
Meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
When you develop these four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics, you’ll pass beyond Death’s domain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Venerable Uttiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Uttiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
or mind …
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The compassionate one, who sees the utter ending of rebirth, &lt;br&gt;
understands the path to convergence. &lt;br&gt;
By this path people crossed over before, &lt;br&gt;
will cross, and are crossing.” &lt;/p&gt;

This is my instruction to you. &lt;/p&gt;

That’s how a mendicant is mindful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is a mendicant aware?
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
That’s how a mendicant acts with situational awareness.
A mendicant should live mindful and aware.
This is my instruction to you.” &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once upon a time, mendicants, an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and said to his apprentice Medakathālikā,
‘Come now, dear Medakathālikā, climb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, teacher,’ she replied. She climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on her teacher’s shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the acrobat said to Medakathālikā,
‘You look after me, dear Medakathālikā, and I’ll look after you.
That’s how, guarding and looking after each other, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Medakathālikā said to her teacher,
‘That’s not how it is, teacher!
You should look after yourself, and I’ll look after myself.
That’s how, guarding and looking after ourselves, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the way,” said the Buddha. “It’s just as Medakathālikā said to her teacher.
Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do you look after others by looking after yourself?
By development, cultivation, and practice of meditation.
And how do you look after yourself by looking after others?
By acceptance, harmlessness, love, and sympathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, suppose that on hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land! The finest lady in the land!’ a large crowd would gather.
And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way.
On hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing!’ an even larger crowd would gather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land.
And a man with a drawn sword will follow right behind you.
Wherever you spill even a drop, he’ll chop off your head right there.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, mendicants?
Would that person lose focus on that bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is what it means.
‘A bowl of oil filled to the brim’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should train like this:
‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha,

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to Anuruddha: &lt;/p&gt;

Now at that time the householder Sirivaḍḍha was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Sirivaḍḍha is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Sirivaḍḍha asked.
Ānanda consented in silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Sirivaḍḍha, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, I hope you’re coping; I hope you’re getting better. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you should train like this:
‘I’ll meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
I’ll meditate on an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.’
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These four kinds of mindfulness meditation that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I am seen in them.
For I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
I meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
And of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I haven’t given up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate!
You have declared the fruit of non-return.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Well purified ethics and correct view.
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or meditate observing an aspect of the body externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or meditate observing an aspect of the body internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally …
externally …
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally …
externally …
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or meditate observing an aspect of principles internally …
externally …
internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in these three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And that mendicant became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

Please, reverends, meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the body.

principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
This is called mindfulness meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the development of mindfulness meditation?

They observe feelings …

principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
This is called the development of mindfulness meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the practice that leads to the development of mindfulness meditation?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is called the practice that leads to the development of mindfulness meditation.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
or mind …
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings …

The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The compassionate one, who sees the utter ending of rebirth, &lt;br&gt;
understands the path to convergence. &lt;br&gt;
By this path people crossed over before, &lt;br&gt;
will cross over, and are crossing over.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.
When you’ve done this, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four?
Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings …

&lt;p&gt;When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Rightly speaking, you’d call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation a ‘heap of the skillful’.
For these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are entirely a heap of the skillful.” &lt;/p&gt;

And as the quail was being carried off he wailed,
‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others.
If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying,
‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk:
‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail.
When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod.
But the hawk crashed chest-first right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others.
If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others?
It’s the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
This is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t find a vulnerability or get hold of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is a mendicant’s own territory, the domain of the fathers?

In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go,
while in others, monkeys can go but not humans.
There are also level, pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go.
There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar.
But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free his hand, he grabs it with his other hand.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free both hands, he grabs it with a foot.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout.
He gets stuck there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching. He’d meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants with him.
The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of wood, and goes wherever he wants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others.
If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, Māra will catch you and get hold of you. &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī.
I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said,
while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.
But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.
Then it occurred to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.
Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”
So that is what he did.
Then the Buddha’s illness died down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable,
that he’s well,
and that he’s alright.
Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind.
Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that
the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda?
I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings.
The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anyone who thinks:
‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha.
But the Realized One doesn’t think like this,
so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.
I’m currently eighty years old.
Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps,
in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, dragons grow and wax strong supported by the Himalayas, the king of mountains.
When they’re strong they dive into the pools. Then they dive into the lakes, the streams, the rivers, and finally the ocean. There they acquire a great and abundant body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great and abundant good qualities.
And how does a mendicant develop the seven awakening factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great and abundant good qualities? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of investigation of principles … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of energy … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of rapture … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of tranquility … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of immersion … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They develop the awakening factor of equanimity, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great and abundant good qualities.” &lt;/p&gt;

The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.

&lt;p&gt;Few are those among humans &lt;br&gt;

The rest just run &lt;br&gt;

those who practice accordingly &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rid of dark qualities, &lt;br&gt;
an astute person should develop the bright. &lt;br&gt;
Leaving home behind &lt;br&gt;
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you should try to find delight there, &lt;br&gt;
having left behind sensual pleasures. &lt;br&gt;
With no possessions, an astute person &lt;br&gt;
should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions. &lt;/p&gt;

Even to hear them,
approach them,
pay homage to them,
recollect them,
or go forth following them is very helpful, I say.
Why is that?
Because after hearing the teaching of such mendicants, a mendicant will live withdrawn in both body and mind,
as they recollect and think about that teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness;
they develop it
and perfect it.
As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that teaching with wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles;
they develop it
and perfect it.
As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it.
When they’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it.
When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it.
They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way they can expect seven fruits and benefits.
What seven?
They attain enlightenment early on in this very life.
If not, they attain enlightenment at the time of death.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort.
If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm.
When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way these are the seven fruits and benefits they can expect.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Venerable Udāyī went up to the Buddha … and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How helpful my love and respect for the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence.
For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha.
But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
The Buddha taught me the Dhamma:
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling …
Such is perception …
Such are choices …
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path.
When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand:
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, they will bring me to such a state that I will understand:
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is the path that I acquired. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand:
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Udāyī!
For that is indeed the path that you acquired. When developed and cultivated as you’re living in such a way, it will bring you to such a state that you will understand:
‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;

A mendicant with good friends can expect to develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors?
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,

That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
As they develop the seven awakening factors, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re called awakening factors because they lead to awakening.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The same as the previous discourse.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them:
‘Reverends, which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is sluggish? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time?
Which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is restless? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time?’
Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.
Why is that?
Because they’re out of their element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that?
Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up.
If they toss wet grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, spray it with water, and scatter dirt on it,
could they make it flare up?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that?
Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture.
Why is that?
Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up.
If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it,
could they make it flare up?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture.
Why is that?
Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mind is restless, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture.
Why is that?
Because it’s hard to settle a restless mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone wanted to extinguish a bonfire.
If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it,
could they extinguish it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;

Why is that?
Because it’s hard to settle a restless mind with these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that?

&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone wanted to extinguish a bonfire.

&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, when the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that?
Because it’s easy to settle a restless mind with these things.
But mindfulness is always useful, I say.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.
Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this:
‘Mendicants, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’
We too teach our disciples:
‘Reverends, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’
What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths.
They got up from their seat, thinking: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”
Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them:
‘But reverends, is there a way in which the five hindrances become ten and the seven awakening factors become fourteen?’
Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.
Why is that?
Because they’re out of their element.
I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the way in which the five hindrances become ten?
Sensual desire for what is internal is a hindrance; and sensual desire for what is external is also a hindrance.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of sensual desire’ becomes twofold.
Ill will for what is internal is a hindrance; and ill will for what is external is also a hindrance.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of ill will’ becomes twofold.
Dullness is a hindrance; and drowsiness is also a hindrance.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness’ becomes twofold.
Restlessness is a hindrance; and remorse is also a hindrance.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of restlessness and remorse’ becomes twofold.
Doubt about internal things is a hindrance; and doubt about external things is also a hindrance.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of doubt’ becomes twofold.
This is the way in which the five hindrances become ten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen?
Mindfulness of internal things is the awakening factor of mindfulness; and mindfulness of external things is also the awakening factor of mindfulness.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of mindfulness’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating, exploring, and inquiring into internal things with wisdom is the awakening factor of investigation of principles; and investigating, exploring, and inquiring into external things with wisdom is also the awakening factor of investigation of principles.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of investigation of principles’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical energy is the awakening factor of energy; and mental energy is also the awakening factor of energy.
That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of energy’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapture while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of rapture; and rapture without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of rapture.
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of rapture’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical tranquility is the awakening factor of tranquility; and mental tranquility is also the awakening factor of tranquility.
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of tranquility’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of immersion; and immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of immersion.
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of immersion’ becomes twofold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equanimity for internal things is the awakening factor of equanimity; and equanimity for external things is also the awakening factor of equanimity.
In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of equanimity’ becomes twofold.
This is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced?
And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and you don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. At that time you don’t truly know or see your own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water that was mixed with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder.
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water that was heated by fire, boiling and bubbling.
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in dullness and drowsiness … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water overgrown with moss and aquatic plants.
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in dullness and drowsiness … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness and remorse … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water stirred by the wind, churning, swirling, and rippling.
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness and remorse … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in doubt … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water that was cloudy, murky, and muddy, hidden in the darkness.
Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in doubt and you don’t truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen. At that time you don’t truly know or see your own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced.
This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a time when your heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire and you truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. At that time you truly know and see your own good, the good of another, and the good of both. Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a bowl of water that was not mixed with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder.
A person with good eyesight checking their own reflection would truly know it and see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when your heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire … Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced. &lt;/p&gt;

A person with good eyesight checking their own reflection would truly know it and see it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom.
What seven?
The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms.
Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana.
Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this:
‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We too teach our disciples in just the same way.
What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths.
They got up from their seat, thinking: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”
Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them:
‘But reverends, how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
How is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
How is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
How is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?’
Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.
Why is that?
Because they’re out of their element.
I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by love together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
The apex of the heart’s release by love is the beautiful, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by compassion together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. …
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
Or else, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
The apex of the heart’s release by compassion is the dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by rejoicing together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. …
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
The apex of the heart’s release by rejoicing is the dimension of infinite consciousness, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.
The apex of the heart’s release by equanimity is the dimension of nothingness, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa says this:
‘There is no cause or condition for not knowing and not seeing.
Not knowing and not seeing have no cause or condition.
There is no cause or condition for knowing and seeing.
Knowing and seeing have no cause or condition.’
What does the Buddha say about this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prince, there are causes and conditions for not knowing and not seeing.
Not knowing and not seeing have causes and conditions.
There are causes and conditions for knowing and seeing.
Knowing and seeing have causes and conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, what is the cause and condition for not knowing and not seeing?
How do not knowing and not seeing have causes and conditions?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a time when the heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
This is a cause and condition for not knowing and not seeing.
And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there’s a time when the heart is overcome and mired in ill will …
dullness and drowsiness …
restlessness and remorse …
doubt, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from doubt that has arisen.
This is a cause and condition for not knowing and not seeing.
And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are called the ‘hindrances’, prince.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, Blessed One, these are hindrances!
Indeed, Holy One, these are hindrances!
Overcome by even a single hindrance you wouldn’t truly know or see, let alone all five hindrances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sir, what is the cause and condition for knowing and seeing?
How do knowing and seeing have causes and conditions?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go.
They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of mindfulness.
This is a cause and condition for knowing and seeing.
And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant develops the awakening factor of investigation of principles … energy … rapture … tranquility … immersion …
equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of equanimity.
This is a cause and condition for knowing and seeing.
And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are called the ‘awakening factors’, prince.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, Blessed One, these are awakening factors!
Indeed, Holy One, these are awakening factors!
Endowed with even a single awakening factor you would truly know and see, let alone all seven awakening factors.
When climbing Mount Vulture’s Peak I became fatigued in body and mind. But this has now faded away. And I’ve comprehended the teaching.” &lt;/p&gt;

It’s when a mendicant develops the perception of a skeleton together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how the perception of a skeleton, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the perception of a skeleton is developed and cultivated you can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.
How so?…” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when the perception of a skeleton is developed and cultivated it leads to great benefit.
How so?…” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when the perception of a skeleton is developed and cultivated it leads to great sanctuary.

Then the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies.
When I’ve finished breakfast, it’s my habit to
wander from monastery to monastery, from park to park.
There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault.
But what benefit does Master Gotama live for?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The benefit the Realized One lives for, Kuṇḍaliya, is the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill knowledge and freedom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The seven awakening factors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the seven awakening factors?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The three kinds of good conduct.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sense restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Kuṇḍaliya, how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?
A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed.
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed.
But if they see a disagreeable sight they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will.
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear …
smells an agreeable odor with the nose …
tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue …
feels an agreeable touch with the body …
knows an agreeable thought with their mind. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed.
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed.
But if they know a disagreeable thought they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will.
Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant’s mind and body are steady internally, they’re well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights,
sounds,
smells,
tastes,
touches,
and thoughts.
That’s how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?
A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
That’s how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors?
A mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
mind …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom?
A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities, with lack of conscience and prudence following along.
An ignoramus, sunk in ignorance, gives rise to wrong view.
Wrong view gives rise to wrong thought.
Wrong thought gives rise to wrong speech.
Wrong speech gives rise to wrong action.
Wrong action gives rise to wrong livelihood.
Wrong livelihood gives rise to wrong effort.
Wrong effort gives rise to wrong mindfulness.
Wrong mindfulness gives rise to wrong immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge precedes the attainment of skillful qualities, with conscience and prudence following along.
A sage, firm in knowledge, gives rise to right view.
Right view gives rise to right thought.
Right thought gives rise to right speech.
Right speech gives rise to right action.
Right action gives rise to right livelihood.
Right livelihood gives rise to right effort.
Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness.
Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the wanderer Nandiya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, how many things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end.
What eight?
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

If you trod on it with hand or foot, it may well break the skin and produce blood.
Why is that?
Because the spike is pointing the right way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way may well break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment.
Why is that?
Because their view is pointing the right way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way break ignorance, give rise to knowledge, and realize extinguishment?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the right way breaks ignorance, gives rise to knowledge, and realizes extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;

Winds blow from the east, the west, the north, and the south. There are winds that are dusty and dustless, cool and warm, weak and strong.
In the same way, when the noble eightfold path is developed and cultivated the following are fully developed: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, and the seven awakening factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how are they fully developed?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.

They give up by direct knowledge the things that should be given up by direct knowledge. They realize by direct knowledge the things that should be realized by direct knowledge. They develop by direct knowledge the things that should be developed by direct knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge?
It should be said: the five grasping aggregates.
What five?
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
These are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge.
And what are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge?
Ignorance and craving for continued existence.
These are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge.
And what are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge?
Knowledge and freedom.

And what are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge?
Serenity and discernment.

a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying:

&lt;p&gt;What do you think, mendicants?
Would they succeed?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.
Why is that?
The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west.
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying:
‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you?
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’
It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path to resign the training and return to a lesser life.
Why is that?
Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant develop the noble eightfold path?

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Townsville.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda!
Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life.
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go.
They develop right thought …
right speech …
right action …
right livelihood …
right effort …
right mindfulness …
right immersion, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.
For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things.
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.” &lt;/p&gt;

Smells known by the nose …

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, whoever has missed out on the noble eightfold path has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.
Whoever has undertaken the noble eightfold path has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the noble eightfold path?
It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever has missed out on the noble eightfold path has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.
Whoever has undertaken the noble eightfold path has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, when these eight things are developed and cultivated they lead to going from the near shore to the far shore.
What eight?
They are right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
When these eight things are developed and cultivated they lead to going from the near shore to the far shore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Few are those among humans &lt;br&gt;
who cross to the far shore. &lt;br&gt;
The rest just run &lt;br&gt;
around on the near shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the teaching is well explained, &lt;br&gt;
those who practice accordingly &lt;br&gt;
are the ones who will cross over &lt;br&gt;
Death’s domain so hard to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rid of dark qualities, &lt;br&gt;
an astute person should develop the bright. &lt;br&gt;
Leaving home behind &lt;br&gt;
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you should try to find delight there, &lt;br&gt;
having left behind sensual pleasures. &lt;br&gt;
With no possessions, an astute person &lt;br&gt;
should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those whose minds are rightly developed &lt;br&gt;
in the awakening factors; &lt;br&gt;
letting go of attachments, &lt;br&gt;
they delight in not grasping. &lt;br&gt;
With defilements ended, brilliant, &lt;br&gt;
they are extinguished in this world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares.
The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people saw it they exclaimed,
“Wow! That’s a Brahmā vehicle!
It’s a vehicle fit for Brahmā!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;  “Sir, can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training?” &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are all terms for the noble eightfold path:
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When right view is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion.
When right thought …
right speech …
right action …
right livelihood …
right effort …
right mindfulness …
right immersion is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a way to understand how these are all terms for the noble eightfold path:
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Its qualities of faith and wisdom &lt;br&gt;
are always yoked to the shaft. &lt;br&gt;
Conscience is its pole, mind its strap, &lt;br&gt;
and mindfulness its careful driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chariot’s equipped with ethics, &lt;br&gt;
its axle is absorption, and energy its wheel. &lt;br&gt;
Equanimity and immersion are the carriage-shaft, &lt;br&gt;
and it’s upholstered with desirelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good will, harmlessness, and seclusion &lt;br&gt;
are its weapons, &lt;br&gt;
patience its shield and armor, &lt;br&gt;
as it rolls on to sanctuary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supreme Brahmā vehicle &lt;br&gt;
arises in oneself. &lt;br&gt;
The wise leave the world in it, &lt;br&gt;
sure of winning the victory.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, sometimes wanderers who follow other paths ask us:
‘Reverends, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?’
We answer them like this:
‘The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is to completely understand suffering.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.
For the purpose of leading the spiritual life under me is to completely understand suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you:
‘Is there a path and a practice for completely understanding that suffering?’ You should answer them like this:
‘There is.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that path?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the path and the practice for completely understanding suffering.
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And what is the noble eightfold path?
It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right view?
Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
This is called right view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right thought?
It is the thought of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.
This is called right thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right speech?
Avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.
This is called right speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right action?
Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual activity.
This is called right action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right livelihood?
It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood.
This is called right livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right effort?
It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have not arisen do arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.
This is called right effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right mindfulness?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
This is called right mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is right immersion?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is called right immersion.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant accomplished in proper attention develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant accomplished in proper attention develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the wrong way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, there’s no way it could break the skin and produce blood.
Why is that?
Because the spike is pointing the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the wrong way cannot break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment.
Why is that?
Because their view is pointing the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the nun Khemā was wandering in the land of the Kosalans between Sāvatthī and Sāketa when she took up residence in Toraṇavatthu.
Then King Pasenadi was traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, and he too stayed in Toraṇavatthu for a single night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,
“Please, mister, check if there’s a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man. He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there,
so he went to the king and said to him, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to.
But there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
She has a good reputation as being
astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent.
Your Majesty may pay homage to her.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am, does a Realized One exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am, when asked these questions, you say
that this has not been declared by the Buddha.
What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, great king? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is,
how many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, ma’am.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is,
how many gallons of water there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, ma’am.
Why is that?
Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, great king, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,
like the ocean.
To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any feeling … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perception …
choices … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,
like the ocean.
To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter!
This one time I went to the nun Khemā and asked her about this matter.
And she explained it to me with these words and phrases, just like the Buddha.
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now, sir, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, does the self exist absolutely?”
But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then does the self not exist absolutely?”
But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, not long after Vacchagotta had left, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, why didn’t you answer Vacchagotta’s question?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, when Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists.
When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ would that have helped give rise to the knowledge that
all things are not-self?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’, Vacchagotta—who is already confused—would have got even more confused, thinking:
‘It seems that the self that I once had no longer exists.’” &lt;/p&gt;

Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to him, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to Sabhiya Kaccāna: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Kaccāna, does a Realized One exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccha, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Kaccāna, when asked these questions, you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha.
What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to describe him as ‘possessing form’ or ‘formless’ or ‘percipient’ or ‘non-percipient’ or ‘neither percipient nor non-percipient’, there must be some cause or reason for doing so. But if that cause and reason were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over,
how could you describe him in any such terms?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Kaccāna, how long has it been since you went forth?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not long, reverend: three years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, you’ve learned a lot already, let alone what lies ahead!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on undeclared questions are complete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut.
Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways:
After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways:
After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the wanderers said to him,
“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.”
Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought,
“If those wanderers were to inquire further,
how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Anurādha?
Is form permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, Anurādha, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Any kind of feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, Anurādha?
Do you regard the Realized One as form?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Anurādha?
Do you regard the Realized One as in form?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling …
or distinct from feeling …
as in perception …
or distinct from perception …
as in choices …
or distinct from choices …
as in consciousness …
or as distinct from consciousness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Anurādha?
Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Anurādha?
Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In that case, Anurādha, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare:
‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways:
After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, Anurādha!
In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Koṭṭhita, does a Realized One exist after death?” … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, when asked these questions, you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha.
What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, if you like, love, and enjoy form, and don’t truly see the cessation of form, you think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ or
‘a Realized One doesn’t exist after death’ or
‘a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death’ or
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, love, and enjoy feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness, and don’t truly see the cessation of consciousness, you think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like, love, and enjoy form …
feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness, and you truly see the cessation of consciousness, you don’t think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the cause, this is the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But reverend, could there be another way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There could, reverend.
If you like, love, and enjoy existence, and don’t truly see the cessation of continued existence, you think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’
If you don’t like, love, and enjoy existence, and you truly see the cessation of continued existence, you don’t think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’
This too is a way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But reverend, could there be another way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There could, reverend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, love, and enjoy grasping, and don’t truly see the cessation of grasping, you think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like, love, and enjoy grasping, and you truly see the cessation of grasping, you don’t think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too is a way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But reverend, could there be another way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There could, reverend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, love, and enjoy craving, and don’t truly see the cessation of craving, you think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like, love, and enjoy craving, and you truly see the cessation of craving, you don’t think ‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too is a way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But reverend, could there be another way of explaining why this was not declared by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, reverend, what more could you want?
For one who is freed due to the ending of craving, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found.” &lt;/p&gt;

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, a few days ago several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who follow various other paths were sitting together in the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them:
‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
When a disciple passes away, he declares that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.
And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Makkhali Gosāla …
Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta …
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta …
Pakudha Kaccāyana …
Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
When a disciple passes away, he declares that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.
And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ascetic Gotama leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
When a disciple passes away, he declares that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he doesn’t declare that
this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.
Rather, he declares that they have
cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering.
I had doubt and uncertainty about that:
‘How on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotama’s teaching?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccha, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain.
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.
It’s like a fire which only burns with fuel, not without fuel.
In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when a flame is blown away by the wind, what do you say is its fuel then?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At such a time, I say that it’s fueled by wind.
For the wind is its fuel then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms, what does Master Gotama say is their fuel then?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When someone who is attached has laid down this body, Vaccha, and has not been reborn in one of the realms, I say they’re fueled by craving.
For craving is their fuel then.” &lt;/p&gt;

Mindfulness of the body.

Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the haven?
The ending of greed, hate, and delusion.
This is called the haven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the path that leads to the haven?
Mindfulness of the body.
This is called the path that leads to the haven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, mendicants, I’ve taught you the haven and the path that leads to the haven.
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This should be expanded as with the unconditioned.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on the unconditioned are complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the chief named Fury went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some people are regarded as furious,
while others are regarded as sweet-natured?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take someone who hasn’t given up greed.
So they get annoyed by others, and they show it.
They’re regarded as furious.
They haven’t given up hate.
So they get annoyed by others, and they show it.
They’re regarded as furious.
They haven’t given up delusion.
So they get annoyed by others, and they show it.
They’re regarded as furious.
This is the cause, this is the reason why some people are regarded as furious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But take someone who has given up greed.
So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it.
They’re regarded as sweet-natured.
They’ve given up hate.
So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it.
They’re regarded as sweet-natured.
They’ve given up delusion.
So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it.
They’re regarded as sweet-natured.
This is the cause, this is the reason why some people are regarded as sweet-natured.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the chief named Fury said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, sir, teach me the origin and cessation of suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chief, if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past, saying
‘this is how it was in the past,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that.
If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future, saying
‘this is how it will be in the future,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that.
Rather, chief, I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” Bhadraka replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, chief?
Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would not cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the cause, chief, what’s the reason why, if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow, while if it happens to others it does not?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love.
The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I don’t desire and love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, you may infer to the past and future:
‘All the suffering that arose in the past was rooted and sourced in desire.
For desire is the root of suffering.
All the suffering that will arise in the future will be rooted and sourced in desire.
For desire is the root of suffering.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How well said this was by the Buddha!
‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire.
For desire is the root of suffering.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a boy called Ciravāsi, who resides in a house away from here.
I rise early and send someone, saying:
‘Go, my man, and check on my boy Ciravāsi.’
Until they get back I worry:
‘I hope nothing’s wrong with Ciravāsi!’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, chief?
If Ciravāsi was executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, would it cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could it not, sir?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too is a way to understand:
‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire.
For desire is the root of suffering.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chief?
Before you’d seen or heard of Ciravāsi’s mother, did you have any desire or love or fondness for her?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then was it because you saw or heard of her that you had
desire or love or fondness for her?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, chief?
If Ciravāsi’s mother was executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, would it cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could it not, sir?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This too is a way to understand:
‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire.
For desire is the root of suffering.’” &lt;/p&gt;

Now at that time while the king’s retinue was sitting together in the royal compound this discussion came up among them,
“Gold and money are proper for Sakyan ascetics. They accept and receive gold and money.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the chief Maṇicūḷaka was sitting in that assembly.
He said to that retinue,
“Good sirs, don’t say that.
Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.”
He was able to persuade that assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Maṇicūḷaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. He then said,
“Answering this way, I trust that I repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If gold and money were proper for them, then the five kinds of sensual stimulation would also be proper.
And if the five kinds of sensual stimulation are proper for them, you should definitely regard them as not having the qualities of an ascetic or a follower of the Sakyan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, chief, I say this:
Straw may be looked for by one needing straw; wood may be looked for by one needing wood; a cart may be looked for by one needing a cart; a workman may be looked for by one needing a workman.
But I say that there is no way they can accept or look for gold and money.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Tāḷapuṭa the dancing master came up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’
What does the Buddha say about this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a third time Tāḷapuṭa said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’
What does the Buddha say about this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say:
‘Enough, chief, let it be.
Don’t ask me that.’
Nevertheless, I will answer you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sentient beings are still not free of greed, and are still bound by greed,
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more arousing things.
When sentient beings are still not free of hate, and are still bound by hate,
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more hateful things.
When sentient beings are still not free of delusion, and are still bound by delusion,
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more delusory things.
And so, being heedless and negligent themselves, they’ve encouraged others to be heedless and negligent. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the hell called ‘Laughter’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have such a view:
‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ This is your wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:
hell or the animal realm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Tāḷapuṭa cried and burst out in tears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:
‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But sir, for a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said:
‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the dancing master Tāḷapuṭa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Tāḷapuṭa
became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say:
‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’
Nevertheless, I will answer you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think:
‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’
His foes kill him and finish him off, and
when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the hell called ‘The Fallen’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have such a view:
‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ This is your wrong view.

&lt;p&gt;Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, there are western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, immerse themselves in water, and serve the sacred flame.
When someone has passed away, they truly lift them up, raise them up, and guide them along to heaven.
But what about the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: is he able to ensure that the whole world will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm when their body breaks up, after death?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chief?
Take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.
And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying:
‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’
What do you think, chief?
Would that person be reborn in heaven because of their prayers?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chief, suppose a person were to throw a broad rock into a deep lake.
And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating it with joined palms, and saying:
‘Rise, good rock! Float, good rock! Float to shore, good rock!’
What do you think, chief?
Would that broad rock rise up or float because of their prayers?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.
Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise …
when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chief?
Take a person who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.
And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying:
‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell!’
What do you think, chief?
Would that person be reborn in hell because of their prayers?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chief, suppose a person were to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open. Its shards and chips would sink down, while the ghee or oil in it would rise up.
And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating it with joined palms and saying:
‘Sink, good ghee or oil! Descend, good ghee or oil! Go down, good ghee or oil!”
What do you think, chief?
Would that ghee or oil sink and descend because of their prayers?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, take a person who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.
Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise …
when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! …
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, doesn’t the Buddha live full of compassion for all living beings?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, chief.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, sir, why exactly do you teach some people thoroughly and others less thoroughly?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think? Suppose a farmer has three fields: one’s good, one’s average, and one’s poor—bad ground of sand and salt.
What do you think? When that farmer wants to plant seeds, where would he plant them first: the good field, the average one, or the poor one?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, he’d plant them first in the good field, then the average, then he may or may not plant seed in the poor field.
Why is that?
Because at least it can be fodder for the cattle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, the monks and nuns are like the good field.
I teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
Why is that?
Because they live with me as their island, protection, shelter, and refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the laymen and laywomen are like the average field.
I also teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
Why is that?
Because they live with me as their island, protection, shelter, and refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who follow other paths are like the poor field, the bad ground of sand and salt.
I also teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
Why is that?
Hopefully they might understand even a single sentence, which would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a person had three water jars: one that’s uncracked and nonporous; one that’s uncracked but porous; and one that’s cracked and porous.
What do you think? When that person wants to store water, where would they store it first: in the jar that’s uncracked and nonporous, the one that’s uncracked but porous, or the one that’s cracked and porous?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, they’d store water first in the jar that’s uncracked and nonporous, then the one that’s uncracked but porous, then they may or may not store water in the one that’s cracked and porous.
Why is that?
Because at least it can be used for washing the dishes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, the monks and nuns are like the water jar that’s uncracked and nonporous.
I teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.

&lt;p&gt;Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“Chief, how does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teach his disciples?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, this is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples:
‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steal, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.
You’re led on by what you usually live by.’
This is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chief?
Take a person who kills living creatures. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re killing or when they’re not killing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The occasions when they’re killing are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not killing are more frequent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, chief?
Take a person who steals … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a person who commits sexual misconduct … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a person who lies. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re lying or when they’re not lying?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The occasions when they’re lying are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not lying are more frequent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some teacher who has this doctrine and view:
‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’
And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher.
They think:
‘My teacher has this doctrine and view:
‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’
But I’ve killed living creatures …
stolen …
committed sexual misconduct …
or lied.
They get the view: ‘I too am going to a place of loss, to hell.’
Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
In many ways he criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: ‘Stop killing living creatures!’
He criticizes and denounces stealing …
sexual misconduct …
lying, saying: ‘Stop lying!’
And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher.
Then they reflect:
‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: “Stop killing living creatures!”
But I have killed living creatures to a certain extent.
That’s not right, it’s not good,
and I feel remorseful because of it.
But I can’t undo what I have done.’
Reflecting like this, they give up killing living creatures,
and in future they don’t kill living creatures.
That’s how to give up this bad deed
and get past it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces stealing … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces sexual misconduct … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces lying, saying: “Stop lying!”
But I have lied to a certain extent.
That’s not right, it’s not good, and I feel remorseful because of it. But I can’t undo what I have done.’
Reflecting like this, they give up lying, and in future they refrain from lying.
That’s how to give up this bad deed and get past it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They give up killing living creatures.
They give up stealing.
They give up sexual misconduct.
They give up lying.
They give up divisive speech.
They give up harsh speech.
They give up talking nonsense.
They give up covetousness.
They give up ill will and malevolence.
They give up wrong view and have right view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions.
In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions.
In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

There he stayed near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that was a time of famine and scarcity in Nāḷandā, with blighted crops turned to straw.
At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.
Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.
Then you will get a good reputation:
‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how am I to do this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, brahmin, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:
‘Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?’
When he’s asked this, if he answers:
‘Indeed I do, chief,’ say this to him:
‘So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw?
The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’
When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Asibandhaka’s son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed I do, chief.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw?
The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, chief, I recollect ninety eons back but I’m not aware of any family that’s been ruined merely by offering some cooked alms-food.
Rather, rich, affluent, and wealthy families—with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—all acquired their wealth because of generosity, truth, and restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief, there are eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families.
Their ruin stems from rulers, bandits, fire, or flood. Or their savings vanish. Or their business fails due to not applying themselves to work. Or a wastrel is born into the family who squanders and fritters away their wealth. And impermanence is the eighth.
These are the eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that these eight reasons are found, suppose someone says this:
‘The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’
Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senior mendicants answered like this:
“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some senior mendicants answered like this:
“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business.
He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,
“Sirs, I heard that you were discussing whether the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ differ in both meaning and phrasing, or whether they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sirs, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile.
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke.
Would it be right to say that
the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, householder.
The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox.
The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind is not the fetter of thoughts, nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,
to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta,
“Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they said this, Citta said to them,
“That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members said,
“Be mindful, master! Don’t babble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What have I said that makes you say that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s because you said:
‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, well, that’s because the deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees said to me:
‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’
So I said to them:
‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what reason do they see for saying that to you?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They think:
‘This householder Citta is ethical, of good character.
If he makes a wish to
become a wheel-turning monarch in the future, his heart’s wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics. And then as a proper, principled king he will provide proper spirit-offerings.’
That’s the reason they see for saying to me:
‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’
So I said to them:
‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then, master, advise us!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you should train like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we will share without reservation all the gifts available to give in our family with those who are ethical and of good character.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after Citta had encouraged his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members in the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, and generosity, he passed away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses on Citta the Householder are complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,
“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They consented in silence.
Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the senior venerable,
“Sir, they speak of ‘the diversity of elements’.
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the senior venerable kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a third time, Citta asked him,
“Sir, they speak of ‘the diversity of elements’.
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha.
He said to the senior venerable,
“Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, is this your question:
‘They speak of “the diversity of elements”.
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the diversity of elements spoken of by the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye element, the sights element, the eye consciousness element … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind element, the thought element, the mind consciousness element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the Buddha spoke of the diversity of elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta,
“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t.
So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,
“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal in my barn.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s barn, and sat down on the seats spread out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milk-rice made with ghee.
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.
Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed, then followed behind the senior mendicants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the heat was sweltering.
And those senior mendicants walked along as if their bodies were melting, as happens after a meal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha.
Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable,
“Wouldn’t it be nice, sir, if a cool wind blew, a cloud canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka.”
Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form, and a gentle rain would drizzle down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta thought,
“The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they reached the monastery, Mahaka said to the senior venerable,
“Sir, is that sufficient?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s sufficient, Reverend Mahaka,
you’ve done enough
and offered enough.”
Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings,
and Mahaka entered his own dwelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta went up to Mahaka, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, then, householder, place your upper robe on the porch and spread a handful of grass on it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Citta, and did as he was asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door, and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe.
Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta,
“Is that sufficient, householder?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s sufficient, sir,
you’ve done enough
and offered enough.
I hope Venerable Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa,
for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely.
I’ll make sure that Venerable Mahaka is provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s nice of you to say, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mahaka set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa,
never to return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the senior venerable: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world. For example:
the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in the Prime Net Discourse.
When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the senior venerable kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a third time, Citta said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world. …
When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha.
He said to the senior venerable,
“Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, is this your question:
‘There are many different views that arise in the world …
When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?’’
“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, there are many different views that arise in the world. For example:
the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in the Prime Net Discourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These views come to be when identity view exists. When identity view does not exist they do not come to be.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how does identity view come about?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They regard feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how identity view comes about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how does identity view not come about?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They don’t regard feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how identity view does not come about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, where has Venerable Isidatta come from?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I come from Avanti, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, there’s a friend of mine called Isidatta who I’ve never met. He’s gone forth from a good family in Avanti.
Have you met him?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, where is that venerable now staying?”
When he said this, Isidatta kept silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, are you that Isidatta?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I hope Venerable Isidatta is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa,
for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely.
I’ll make sure that Venerable Isidatta is provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s nice of you to say, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta,
“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t.
So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa,
never to return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, bowed, and sat down to one side. Kāmabhū said to him, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, there is this saying: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘With flawless wheel and white canopy, &lt;br&gt;
the one-spoke chariot rolls on. &lt;br&gt;
See it come, untroubled, &lt;br&gt;
with stream cut, unbound.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, was this spoken by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, sir, please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this.”
Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, ‘flawless wheel’ is a term for ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘White canopy’ is a term for freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘One spoke’ is a term for mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Rolls on’ is a term for going forward and coming back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Chariot’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.
That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘untroubled’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The one who comes’ is a term for the perfected one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Stream’ is a term for craving.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given this up, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, and obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have ‘cut the stream’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed, hate, and delusion are bonds.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.
That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘unbound’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘With flawless wheel and white canopy, &lt;br&gt;
the one-spoke chariot rolls on. &lt;br&gt;
See it come, untroubled, &lt;br&gt;
with stream cut, unbound.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,
to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one side, and said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, how many processes are there?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, there are three processes.
Physical, verbal, and mental processes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process.
First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes.
Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think:
‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’
Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated.
When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear.
That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think:
‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’
Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They experience three kinds of contact:
emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, householder, you’ve finally asked what you should have asked first!
Nevertheless, I will answer you.
Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling:
serenity and discernment.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Godatta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Godatta said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, the limitless release of the heart, and the release of the heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.
But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
This is called the limitless release of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the release of the heart through nothingness?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
This is called the release of the heart through nothingness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the release of the heart through emptiness?
It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’
This is called the release of the heart through emptiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the signless heart’s release?
It’s when a mendicant, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.
This is called the signless release of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of limits.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of limitless release of the heart.
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed is something, hate is something, and delusion is something.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of release of the heart through nothingness.
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of signs.
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.

That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,
to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citta the householder heard that they had arrived.
Together with several lay followers, he went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him,
“Householder, do you have faith in the ascetic Gotama’s claim that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and said,
“See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges river with your own hand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, sir?
Which is better—knowledge or faith?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption.
And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption.
And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and said,
“See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, just now I understood you to say:
‘See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all.’
But then I understood you to say:
‘See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!’
If your first statement is true, the second is wrong.
If your first statement is wrong, the second is true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant.
When you understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain ascetics, you can rebut me.
‘One thing: question, summary, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary, and answer.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta these ten legitimate questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citta the householder heard that he had arrived.
So he went up to him, and they exchanged greetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa,
“Sir, Kassapa, how long has it been since you went forth?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been thirty years, householder.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citta said to him,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing,
how well explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, no meditation at ease, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been thirty years, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How, sir, could I not?
For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption.
And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption.
And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me:
‘The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing,
how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants, and said to them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of mine.
May the senior monks give him the going forth, the ordination.
I’ll make sure that he’s provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘They speak of this thing called the “first absorption”.
What is the first absorption?’
It occurred to me:
‘It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called the first absorption.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so … I was entering and remaining in the first absorption.
While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna!
Don’t neglect the first absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the first absorption; unify your mind and immerse it in the first absorption.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, after some time … I entered and remained in the first absorption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if anyone should be rightly called
a disciple who attained to great direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it’s me.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then Sakka, lord of gods, with five hundred deities came up to Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and stood to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lord of gods, it’s good to go for refuge to the Buddha.
It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
It’s good to go for refuge to the teaching.

&lt;p&gt;Then Sakka, lord of gods, with five hundred deities came up to Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and stood to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lord of gods, it’s good to have experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to have experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to have the ethical conduct that’s loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” &lt;/p&gt;

What is the second absorption?”
It occurred to me:
‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called the second absorption.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so … I was entering and remaining in the second absorption.
While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna!

What is the third absorption?
It occurred to me:
‘With the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”
This is called the third absorption.’ &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
There the Buddha … said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, the life span of humans is short.
You must go to the next life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the spiritual life.
No-one born is immortal.
A long life is a hundred years or a little more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days and nights don’t rush by, &lt;br&gt;
and life isn’t cut short. &lt;br&gt;
The life of mortals keeps rolling on, &lt;br&gt;
like a chariot’s rim around the hub.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days and nights rush by, &lt;br&gt;
and then life is cut short. &lt;br&gt;
The life of mortals wastes away, &lt;br&gt;
like the water in tiny streams.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Māra thought,
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why now do you roar like a lion? &lt;br&gt;
You’re so self-assured in the assembly! &lt;br&gt;
For there is someone who’ll wrestle with you, &lt;br&gt;
so why do you imagine you’re the victor?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great heroes they roar, &lt;br&gt;
self-assured in the assemblies. &lt;br&gt;
The Realized One, attained to power, &lt;br&gt;
has crossed over clinging to the world.” &lt;/p&gt;

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“I am truly freed from that grueling work!
Thank goodness I’m freed from that pointless grueling work.
Thank goodness that, steadfast and mindful, I have attained awakening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, went up to him and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve departed from the practice of mortification &lt;br&gt;
by which humans purify themselves. &lt;br&gt;
You’re impure, but think yourself pure; &lt;br&gt;
you’ve strayed from the path of purity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realized that it’s pointless; &lt;br&gt;
all that mortification in search of immortality &lt;br&gt;
is as futile &lt;br&gt;
as oars and rudder on dry land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethics, immersion, and wisdom: &lt;br&gt;
by developing this path to awakening &lt;br&gt;
I attained ultimate purity. &lt;br&gt;
You’re beaten, terminator!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and crushed some large boulders close by him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter.
The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable.
But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.
And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you feeble that you lie down? Or are you drunk on poetry? &lt;br&gt;
Don’t you have all that you need? &lt;br&gt;
Alone in a secluded lodging, &lt;br&gt;
why this sleeping, sleepyhead?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not feeble that I lie down, nor am I drunk on poetry. &lt;br&gt;
Having reached the goal, I’m rid of sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
Alone in a secluded lodging, &lt;br&gt;
I lie down full of compassion for all living creatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those with a dart stuck in the breast, &lt;br&gt;
piercing the heart again and again, &lt;br&gt;
are able to get some sleep. &lt;br&gt;
So why not I, whose dart is drawn out? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t lie awake tense, nor do I fear to sleep. &lt;br&gt;
The days and nights don’t disturb me, &lt;br&gt;
as I see no decline for myself in the world. &lt;br&gt;
That’s why I lie down full of compassion for all living creatures.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a mental snare &lt;br&gt;
wandering the sky. &lt;br&gt;
I’ll bind you with it—&lt;br&gt;
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, &lt;br&gt;
and touches so delightful: &lt;br&gt;
desire for these is gone from me. &lt;br&gt;
You’re beaten, terminator!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra thought,
“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not appropriate for you &lt;br&gt;
to instruct others. &lt;br&gt;
As you engage in this, &lt;br&gt;
don’t get caught up in favoring and opposing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Buddha instructs others &lt;br&gt;
out of compassion for their welfare. &lt;br&gt;
The Realized One is liberated &lt;br&gt;
from favoring and opposing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the five grasping aggregates.
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra thought,
“This ascetic Gotama is educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the five grasping aggregates.
And the mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time several alms bowls were placed in the open air.
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of an ox and approached those bowls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the mendicants said to another,
“Mendicant, mendicant, that ox will break the bowls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant,
“Mendicant, that’s no ox.
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sights, feeling, and perception, &lt;br&gt;
consciousness and what is chosen: &lt;br&gt;
‘I am not this’ and ‘this is not mine’; &lt;br&gt;
that’s how to be free of desire them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re detached, secure, &lt;br&gt;
all fetters transcended, &lt;br&gt;
though Māra and his army chase everywhere &lt;br&gt;
they never find you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time in Pañcasālā the young women were taking care of guests.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Pañcasālā for alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Māra had possessed the brahmins and householders of Pañcasālā, so that they thought,
“Don’t let the ascetic Gotama get any alms!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha left the village with his bowl as clean-washed as it was when he entered for alms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“Well, ascetic, did you get any alms?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wicked One, did you make sure I didn’t get any alms?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, sir, let the Buddha enter Pañcasālā a second time for alms.
I’ll make sure you get alms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Māra’s made bad karma &lt;br&gt;
in attacking the Realized One. &lt;br&gt;
Wicked One, do you imagine that &lt;br&gt;
your wickedness won’t bear fruit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us live so very happily,&lt;br&gt;
we who have nothing.&lt;br&gt;
We shall feed on rapture, &lt;br&gt;
like the gods of streaming radiance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact.
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra thought,
“This ascetic Gotama is educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact.
And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth were shattering, so that one of the mendicants said to another,
“Mendicant, mendicant, it seems like the earth is shattering!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant,
“Mendicant, that’s not the earth shattering.
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, &lt;br&gt;
touches, and thoughts, the lot of them—&lt;br&gt;
this is the dreadful bait &lt;br&gt;
that the world’s infatuated by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a mindful disciple of the Buddha &lt;br&gt;
has transcended all that. &lt;br&gt;
Having slipped free of Māra’s sway, &lt;br&gt;
they shine like the sun.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment.
And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra thought,
“The ascetic Gotama is giving a Dhamma talk about extinguishment … and the mendicants are listening well.
Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a farmer carrying a large plough on his shoulder. He held a long goad, his hair was messy, he was clad in sunn hemp, and his feet were muddy. He went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“So, ascetic, did you happen to see any oxen?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what have you to do with oxen, Wicked One?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mine alone, ascetic, is the eye, mine are sights, mine is the field of eye contact consciousness.
Where can you escape me, ascetic?
Mine alone is the ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind, mine are thoughts, mine is the field of mind contact consciousness.
Where can you escape me, ascetic?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yours alone, ascetic, is the eye, yours are sights, yours is the field of eye contact consciousness.
Where there is no eye, no sights, no eye contact consciousness—you have no place there, Wicked One!
Yours alone is the ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind, yours are thoughts, yours is the field of mind contact consciousness.
Where there is no mind, no thoughts, no mind contact consciousness—you have no place there, Wicked One!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The things they call ‘mine’, &lt;br&gt;
and those who say ‘it’s mine’: &lt;br&gt;
if your mind remains there, &lt;br&gt;
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The things they speak of aren’t mine; &lt;br&gt;
I’m not someone who speaks like that. &lt;br&gt;
So know this, Wicked One: &lt;br&gt;
you won’t even see the path I take.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge elephant king and approached him.
Its head was like a huge block of soapstone.
Its tusks were like pure silver.
Its trunk was like a long plough pole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Transmigrating for such a long time, &lt;br&gt;
you’ve made forms beautiful and ugly. &lt;br&gt;
Enough of this, Wicked One! &lt;br&gt;
You’re beaten, terminator!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“I wonder if it’s possible to rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, went up to him and said,
“Rule, Blessed One! Rule, Holy One! Rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what do you see, Wicked One, that you say this to me?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Blessed One, sir, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.
If he wished, the Blessed One need only determine that the Himalaya, king of mountains, was gold, and it would turn into gold.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take a golden mountain, &lt;br&gt;
made entirely of gold, and double it—&lt;br&gt;
it’s still not enough for one! &lt;br&gt;
Knowing this, live a moral life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person has seen where suffering comes from &lt;br&gt;
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures? &lt;br&gt;
Realizing that attachment is a chain in the world, &lt;br&gt;
a person would train to remove it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there. &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock, wearing an antelope hide. He was old, bent double, wheezing, and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood. He went up to those mendicants and said,
“You’ve gone forth while young, reverends. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures.
Enjoy human sensual pleasures.
Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing.
We’re giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present.
For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, that was no brahmin.
That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyes!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a person has seen where suffering comes from &lt;br&gt;
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures? &lt;br&gt;
Realizing that attachment is a chain in the world, &lt;br&gt;
a person would train to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute.
Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,
to have a teacher who is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha!
I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,
to have gone forth in a teaching and training so well explained!
I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,
to have spiritual companions who are ethical and of good character.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Samiddhi was thinking, went up to him and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth was shattering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Samiddhi, that’s not the earth shattering.
That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!
Go back to that same place, Samiddhi, and meditate, diligent, keen, and resolute.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Samiddhi. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a second time Samiddhi was meditating in that same place, diligent, ardent, and resolute.
And for a second time he had the same thought …
and Māra made an earth-shattering noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Samiddhi addressed Māra the Wicked One in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went forth out of faith &lt;br&gt;
from the lay life to homelessness. &lt;br&gt;
My mindfulness and wisdom are mature, &lt;br&gt;
my mind is serene in immersion. &lt;br&gt;
Make whatever illusions you want, &lt;br&gt;
it won’t bother me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The mendicant Samiddhi knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock.
Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart.
But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart.
For a second …
third …
fourth …
fifth …
sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of heart.
But for a sixth time he fell away from it.
For a seventh time Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he thought,
“I’ve fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times.
Why don’t I slit my wrists?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Godhika was thinking, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O great hero, O greatly wise! &lt;br&gt;
Shining with power and glory. &lt;br&gt;
You’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, &lt;br&gt;
I bow to your feet, O seer! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great hero, master of death, &lt;br&gt;
your disciple longs for death, &lt;br&gt;
he’s planning for it. &lt;br&gt;
Stop him, O light-bringer! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For how, Blessed One, can a disciple of yours, &lt;br&gt;
one who loves your teaching, &lt;br&gt;
a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, &lt;br&gt;
take his own life, O renowned one?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already slit his wrists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is how the wise act, &lt;br&gt;
for they don’t long for life. &lt;br&gt;
Having plucked out craving, root and all, &lt;br&gt;
Godhika is extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a good family, slit his wrists.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” they replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.
The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika’s consciousness, wondering:
‘Where is Godhika’s consciousness established?’
But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra, carrying his harp of yellow wood apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Above, below, and all around, &lt;br&gt;
in the four quarters and in-between, &lt;br&gt;
I’ve been searching without success: &lt;br&gt;
where has that Godhika got to?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was a wise and steadfast sage, &lt;br&gt;
a meditator who loved to practice absorption. &lt;br&gt;
By day and by night he applied himself, &lt;br&gt;
without concern for his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He defeated the army of death, &lt;br&gt;
and won’t return for any future life. &lt;br&gt;
Having plucked out craving, root and all &lt;br&gt;
Godhika is extinguished.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stricken with sorrow&lt;br&gt;
that his harp dropped from his armpit, &lt;br&gt;
that spirit, downcast, &lt;br&gt;
vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest? &lt;br&gt;
Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? &lt;br&gt;
Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village? &lt;br&gt;
Why don’t you get too close to people? &lt;br&gt;
And why does no-one get close to you?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely. &lt;br&gt;
I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
I’ve cut off all greed and hunger for future lives. &lt;br&gt;
Undefiled, I practice absorption, O kinsman of the negligent!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The things they call ‘mine’, &lt;br&gt;
and those who say ‘it’s mine’: &lt;br&gt;
if your mind remains there, &lt;br&gt;
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The things they speak of aren’t mine; &lt;br&gt;
I’m not someone who speaks like that. &lt;br&gt;
So know this, Wicked One: &lt;br&gt;
you won’t even see the path I take.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve discovered the path &lt;br&gt;
that’s safe, and leads to the deathless, &lt;br&gt;
go and walk that path alone—&lt;br&gt;
why teach it to anyone else?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those crossing to the far shore &lt;br&gt;
ask what’s beyond the domain of Death. &lt;br&gt;
When I’m asked, I explain to them &lt;br&gt;
the truth without attachments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village,
and a crab lived there.
Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.
Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.
And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all my tricks, dodges, and evasions.
Now I’m not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A crow once circled a stone &lt;br&gt;
that looked like a lump of fat. &lt;br&gt;
‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought, &lt;br&gt;
‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But finding nothing tasty, &lt;br&gt;
the crow left that place. &lt;br&gt;
Like the crow that pecked the stone, &lt;br&gt;
I leave Gotama disappointed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away generated a rainbow of bright colors, both beautiful and ugly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Transmigrating for such a long time, &lt;br&gt;
you’ve made forms beautiful and ugly. &lt;br&gt;
Enough of this, Wicked One! &lt;br&gt;
You’re beaten, terminator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are well restrained &lt;br&gt;
in body, speech, and mind &lt;br&gt;
don’t fall under Māra’s sway, &lt;br&gt;
they don’t become your footmen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saṁyutta Nikāya ("The Linked Discourses")]]></title><description><![CDATA[And then Māra the Wicked, after reciting these verses of disillusionment in the Buddha’s presence, left that place.

He sat cross-legged on the ground not far from the Buddha, silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, scratching the ground with a stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked, and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why so downhearted, dad? &lt;br&gt;
What man are you upset about? &lt;br&gt;
We’ll catch him with the snare of lust, &lt;br&gt;
like an elephant in the wild. &lt;br&gt;
We’ll tie him up and bring him back—&lt;br&gt;
he’ll fall under your sway!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. &lt;br&gt;
He’s not easily seduced by lust. &lt;br&gt;
He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m so upset.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and said to him,
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”
But the Buddha ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.
“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes.
Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred young maidens?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.
“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes.
Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred women who have never given birth?”
So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Craving, Delight, and Lust …
each manifested in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   women who have given birth twice …
middle-aged women … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   old women …
But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side and said,
“What our father said is true: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. &lt;br&gt;
He’s not easily seduced by lust. &lt;br&gt;
He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; &lt;br&gt;
that’s why I’m so upset.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not free of lust, his heart would explode, or he’d spew hot blood from his mouth, or he’d go mad and lose his mind.
He’d dry up, wither away, and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side.
Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest? &lt;br&gt;
Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? &lt;br&gt;
Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village? &lt;br&gt;
Why don’t you get too close to people? &lt;br&gt;
And why does no-one get close to you?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart. &lt;br&gt;
Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant, &lt;br&gt;
alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss. &lt;br&gt;
That’s why I don’t get too close to people, &lt;br&gt;
and no-one gets too close to me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods &lt;br&gt;
usually meditate here while crossing the sixth? &lt;br&gt;
How do they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions &lt;br&gt;
are kept out and don’t get hold of them?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With tranquil body and mind well freed, &lt;br&gt;
without making plans, mindful, homeless; &lt;br&gt;
understanding the teaching, they practice absorption without placing the mind; &lt;br&gt;
they’re not shaking or drifting or rigid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant who has crossed five floods &lt;br&gt;
usually meditates here while crossing the sixth. &lt;br&gt;
That’s how they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions &lt;br&gt;
are kept out and don’t get hold of them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He lives with his community after cutting off craving, &lt;br&gt;
and many of the faithful will cross over for sure. &lt;br&gt;
Alas, this homeless one will snatch many men away, &lt;br&gt;
and lead them past the King of Death!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great heroes they lead &lt;br&gt;
by means of the true teaching. &lt;br&gt;
When the Realized Ones are leading by the teaching, &lt;br&gt;
how could anyone who knows be jealous?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked.
Māra the Wicked saw them coming off in the distance,
and addressed them in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fools! You drill into a mountain &lt;br&gt;
with lotus stalks! &lt;br&gt;
You dig up a hill with your nails! &lt;br&gt;
You chew iron with your teeth! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You seek a footing in the deeps, as it were, &lt;br&gt;
while lifting a rock with your head! &lt;br&gt;
After attacking a stump with your breast, as it were, &lt;br&gt;
you leave Gotama disappointed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They came in their splendor—&lt;br&gt;
Craving, Delight, and Lust. &lt;br&gt;
But the Teacher brushed them off right there, &lt;br&gt;
like the breeze, a fallen tuft.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linked Discourses with Māra are complete.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, I have attained and realized supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort.
You too should attain and realize supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re bound by Māra’s snares, &lt;br&gt;
both human and divine. &lt;br&gt;
You’re bound by Māra’s bonds: &lt;br&gt;
you won’t escape me, ascetic!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m freed from Māra’s snares, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine.
You are also freed from all snares, both human and divine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
Let not two go by one road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will travel to Uruvelā, the village of Senāni, in order to teach the Dhamma.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re bound by all snares, &lt;br&gt;
both human and divine. &lt;br&gt;
You’re bound by the great bond: &lt;br&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge serpent king and approached him.
Its body was like a huge canoe carved from a single tree.
Its hood was like a large brewer’s sieve.
Its eyes were like those big bronze dishes from Kosala.
Its tongue flickered from its mouth like lightning flashes in a thunderstorm.
The sound of its breathing was like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A self-controlled sage frequents &lt;br&gt;
empty buildings for lodging. &lt;br&gt;
It’s appropriate for such a person &lt;br&gt;
to live there after relinquishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there are lots of creepy crawlies, &lt;br&gt;
and lots of flies and snakes, &lt;br&gt;
they wouldn’t stir a hair &lt;br&gt;
of a great sage in that empty hut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sky may split and the earth may quake, &lt;br&gt;
and all creatures be stricken with fear; &lt;br&gt;
and even if an arrow’s aimed at their breast, &lt;br&gt;
the Buddhas take no shelter in attachments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He spent most of the night walking mindfully in the open. At the crack of dawn he washed his feet and entered his dwelling.
He laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What, you’re asleep? Really, you’re asleep? &lt;br&gt;
You sleep like a loser—what’s up with that? &lt;br&gt;
You sleep, thinking that the hut is empty. &lt;br&gt;
You sleep when the sun has come up—what’s up with that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For them there is no craving—&lt;br&gt;
the weaver, the clinger—to track them anywhere. &lt;br&gt;
With the ending of all attachments the awakened Buddha sleeps. &lt;br&gt;
What’s that got to do with you, Māra?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your children bring you delight! &lt;br&gt;
Your cattle also bring you delight! &lt;br&gt;
For attachments are a man’s delight; &lt;br&gt;
without attachments there’s no delight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your children bring you sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
Your cattle also bring you sorrow. &lt;br&gt;
For attachments are a man’s sorrow; &lt;br&gt;
without attachments there are no sorrows.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, the life span of humans is short.
You must go to the next life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the spiritual life.
No-one born is immortal.
A long life is a hundred years or a little more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The life of humans is long! &lt;br&gt;
A good person wouldn’t scorn it. &lt;br&gt;
Live like a suckling babe, &lt;br&gt;
for Death has not come for you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The life of humans is short, &lt;br&gt;
and a good person scorns it. &lt;br&gt;
They should live as though their head was on fire, &lt;br&gt;
for Death comes for everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Māra … vanished right there.&lt;/p&gt;

Then the wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Sāriputta, they speak of this thing called ‘extinguishment’.
What is extinguishment?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, the ending of greed, hate, and delusion
is called extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But, reverend, is there a path and a practice for realizing this extinguishment?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is, reverend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, what is it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the path, the practice, for realizing this extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend, this is a fine path, a fine practice, for realizing this extinguishment.
Just this much is enough to be diligent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(These should be expanded in the same way as the Linked Discourses with Jambukhādaka.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, sir, with my clairvoyance that’s purified and superhuman, I see that a female—when her body breaks up, after death—is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
How many qualities do females have so that they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anuruddha, when females have five qualities, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
What five? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re faithless, shameless, imprudent, irritable, and witless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When females have these five qualities, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops.
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.
The Buddha has spoken of three feelings.
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These are the three feelings the Buddha has spoken of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Buddha has also said:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’
What was the Buddha referring to when he said this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good, mendicant!
I have spoken of these three feelings.
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These are the three feelings I have spoken of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have also said:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I said this I was referring to the impermanence of conditions, to the fact that conditions are
liable to end,
vanish,
fade away,
cease,
and perish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased.
For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased.
For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased.
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have also explained the progressive stilling of conditions.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has stilled.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have stilled. …
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are these six levels of tranquility.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquilized.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have been tranquilized.” &lt;/p&gt;

Winds blow from the east, the west, the north, and the south. There are winds that are dusty and dustless, cool and warm, weak and strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, various feelings arise in this body: pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many and various &lt;br&gt;
winds that blow in the sky. &lt;br&gt;
From the east they come, also the west, &lt;br&gt;
the north, and then the south. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are dusty and dustless, &lt;br&gt;
cool and sometimes warm, &lt;br&gt;
strong and weak; &lt;br&gt;
these are the different breezes that blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too, in this body &lt;br&gt;
feelings arise, &lt;br&gt;
pleasant and painful, &lt;br&gt;
and those that are neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a mendicant is keen, &lt;br&gt;
not neglecting situational awareness, &lt;br&gt;
that astute person &lt;br&gt;
understands all feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely understanding feelings, &lt;br&gt;
they’re without defilements in this very life. &lt;br&gt;
That knowledge-master is firm in principle; &lt;br&gt;
when their body breaks up, they can’t be reckoned.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ānanda, there are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
These are called feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling originates from contact.
When contact ceases, feeling ceases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling: this is its gratification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing and giving up desire and greed for feeling: this is its escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased. …
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased. &lt;/p&gt;

For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have also explained the progressive tranquilizing of conditions.

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, what is feeling? What’s the origin of feeling? What’s the cessation of feeling? What’s the practice that leads to the cessation of feeling?
And what is feeling’s gratification, drawback, and escape?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, there are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
These are called feeling. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This should be told in full as in the previous discourse.) &lt;/p&gt;

In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve taught the Dhamma with all these explanations.
This being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve taught the Dhamma with all these explanations.
This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say:
‘The ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception and feeling, and he includes it in happiness.
What’s up with that?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them:
‘Reverends, when the Buddha describes what’s included in happiness, he’s not just referring to pleasant feeling.
The Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever it’s found, and in whatever context.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the wanderer Moḷiyasīvaka went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.’
What does Master Gotama say about this?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sīvaka, some feelings stem from bile disorders.
You can know this from your own personal experience,
and it is generally agreed to be true.
Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everything an individual experiences is because of past deeds
go beyond personal experience and beyond what is generally agreed to be true.
So those ascetics and brahmins are wrong, I say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some feelings stem from phlegm disorders …
wind disorders …
their conjunction …
change in weather …
not taking care of yourself …
overexertion …
Some feelings are the result of past deeds.
You can know this from your own personal experience,
and it is generally agreed to be true.
Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everything an individual experiences is because of past deeds
go beyond personal experience and beyond what is generally agreed to be true.
So those ascetics and brahmins are wrong, I say.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the wanderer Moḷiyasīvaka said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bile, phlegm, and wind, &lt;br&gt;
their conjunction, and the weather, &lt;br&gt;
not taking care of yourself, overexertion, &lt;br&gt;
and the result of deeds is the eighth.” &lt;/p&gt;

Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the exposition of the teaching on the hundred and eight?
Mendicants, in one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the two feelings?
Physical and mental.
These are called the two feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the three feelings?
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the five feelings?
The faculties of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, and equanimity. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the six feelings?
Feeling born of eye contact … ear contact … nose contact … tongue contact … body contact …
mind contact. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the eighteen feelings?
There are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the thirty-six feelings?
Six kinds of lay happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness. Six kinds of lay sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness. Six kinds of lay equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimity. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the hundred and eight feelings?
Thirty six feelings in the past, future, and present.
These are called the hundred and eight feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exposition of the teaching on the hundred and eight.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicant, there are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
These are called feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling originates from contact.
Craving is the practice that leads to the origin of feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling: this is its gratification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing and giving up desire and greed for feeling: this is its escape.” &lt;/p&gt;

What three? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant has given up these underlying tendencies, they’re called a mendicant without underlying tendencies, who sees rightly, has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel pleasure &lt;br&gt;
without understanding feeling, &lt;br&gt;
the underlying tendency to greed is there, &lt;br&gt;
if you don’t see the escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel pain &lt;br&gt;
without understanding feeling, &lt;br&gt;
the underlying tendency to repulsion is there, &lt;br&gt;
if you don’t see the escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for that peaceful, neutral feeling: &lt;br&gt;
he of vast wisdom has taught &lt;br&gt;
that if you relish it, &lt;br&gt;
you’re still not released from suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a mendicant is keen, &lt;br&gt;
not neglecting situational awareness, &lt;br&gt;
that astute person &lt;br&gt;
understands all feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely understanding feelings, &lt;br&gt;
they’re without defilements in this very life. &lt;br&gt;
That knowledge-master is firm in principle; &lt;br&gt;
when their body breaks up, they can’t be reckoned.” &lt;/p&gt;

there’s a hellish abyss under the ocean,
they’re speaking of something that doesn’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hellish abyss’ is a term for painful physical feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who hasn’t stood up in the hellish abyss and has gained no footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They’re called an educated noble disciple who has stood up in the hellish abyss and gained a footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t abide &lt;br&gt;
those painful physical feelings &lt;br&gt;
that arise and sap your vitality; &lt;br&gt;
if you tremble at their touch, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weeping and wailing, &lt;br&gt;
a weakling lacking strength—&lt;br&gt;
you won’t stand up in the hellish abyss &lt;br&gt;
and gain a footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can endure &lt;br&gt;
those painful physical feelings &lt;br&gt;
that arise and sap your vitality; &lt;br&gt;
if you don’t tremble at their touch—&lt;br&gt;
you stand up in the hellish abyss &lt;br&gt;
and gain a footing.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is material pleasure, spiritual pleasure, and even more spiritual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is material equanimity, spiritual equanimity, and even more spiritual equanimity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is material liberation, spiritual liberation, and even more spiritual liberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is material rapture?
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds … Smells … Tastes …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The rapture that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called material rapture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is spiritual rapture?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called spiritual rapture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is even more spiritual rapture?
When a mendicant who has ended the defilements reviews their mind free from greed, hate, and delusion, rapture arises. This is called even more spiritual rapture. &lt;/p&gt;

The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called material pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
This is called spiritual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is even more spiritual pleasure?
When a mendicant who has ended the defilements reviews their mind free from greed, hate, and delusion, pleasure and happiness arises. This is called even more spiritual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;

The equanimity that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called material equanimity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is spiritual equanimity?
It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is called spiritual equanimity. &lt;/p&gt;

What three? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasant feeling should be seen as suffering. Painful feeling should be seen as a dart. Neutral feeling should be seen as impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant has seen these three feelings in this way,
they’re called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mendicant who sees pleasure as pain, &lt;br&gt;
and suffering as a dart, &lt;br&gt;
and that peaceful, neutral feeling &lt;br&gt;
as impermanent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sees rightly; &lt;br&gt;
they completely understand feelings. &lt;br&gt;
Completely understanding feelings, &lt;br&gt;
they’re without defilements in this very life. &lt;br&gt;
That knowledge-master is firm in principle; &lt;br&gt;
when their body breaks up, they can’t be reckoned.” &lt;/p&gt;

An educated noble disciple also feels pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings.
What, then, is the difference between an ordinary uneducated person and an educated noble disciple?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience two feelings:
physical and mental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow,
only to be struck with a second arrow.
That person experiences the feeling of two arrows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience two feelings:
physical and mental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they’re touched by painful feeling, they resist it.
The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When touched by painful feeling they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures.
Why is that?
Because an uneducated ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures.
Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it attached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it attached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who is attached to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience one feeling:
physical, not mental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow,
but was not struck with a second arrow.
That person would experience the feeling of one arrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience one feeling:
physical, not mental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they’re touched by painful feeling, they don’t resist it.
There’s no underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlying that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When touched by painful feeling they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures.
Why is that?
Because an educated noble disciple understands an escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures.
Since they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, there’s no underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlying that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
There’s no underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlying that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re called an educated noble disciple who is detached from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wise and learned person isn’t affected &lt;br&gt;
by feelings of pleasure and pain. &lt;br&gt;
This is the great difference in skill &lt;br&gt;
between the wise and the ordinary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A learned person who has appraised the teaching &lt;br&gt;
discerns this world and the next. &lt;br&gt;
Desirable things don’t disturb their mind, &lt;br&gt;
nor are they repelled by the undesirable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both favoring and opposing &lt;br&gt;
are cleared and ended, they are no more. &lt;br&gt;
Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state, &lt;br&gt;
they understand rightly, going beyond rebirth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the infirmary, where he sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, a mendicant should await their time mindful and aware.
This is my instruction to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is a mendicant mindful?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind …
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how a mendicant is mindful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is a mendicant aware?
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
That’s how a mendicant is aware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mendicant should await their time mindful and aware.
This is my instruction to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if pleasant feelings arise, they understand:
‘A pleasant feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on this very contact.
But this contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on contact that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in contact and pleasant feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for greed for contact and pleasant feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if painful feelings arise …
if neutral feelings arise, they understand:
‘A neutral feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on this very contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Expand in detail as in the previous discourse.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, a mendicant understands: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’” &lt;/p&gt;

They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and pleasant feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for greed for the body and pleasant feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if painful feelings arise, they understand:
‘A painful feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on my own body.
But this body is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a painful feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and painful feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for repulsion towards the body and painful feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if neutral feelings arise, they understand:
‘A neutral feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on my own body.
But this body is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a neutral feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and neutral feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for ignorance towards the body and neutral feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ &lt;/p&gt;

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, the eye is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear is impermanent. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nose is impermanent. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tongue is impermanent. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is impermanent. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Uddaka, son of Rāma, was no knowledge master, he said ‘I’m a knowledge master.’ Though he was no conqueror of all, he said ‘I’m conqueror of all.’ And though the boil’s root was not dug out, he said ‘I’ve dug out the boil’s root.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how a mendicant would rightly say:
‘This for sure is the knowledge master! This for sure is the conqueror of all! This for sure is the boil’s root dug out, never dug out before!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone a knowledge master?
It’s when a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
That’s how a mendicant is a knowledge master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is a mendicant a conqueror of all?
It’s when a mendicant comes to be freed by not grasping after truly understanding these six sense fields’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
That’s how a mendicant is a conqueror of all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how has a mendicant dug out the boil’s root, which was never dug out before?
‘Boil’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.
‘Boil’s root’ is a term for craving.
It’s when a mendicant has given up craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant has dug out the boil’s root, which was never dug out before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uddaka, son of Rāma, used to say:
‘This for sure is the knowledge master! This for sure is the conqueror of all! This for sure is the boil’s root dug out, never dug out before!’ &lt;/p&gt;

Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the things that are prone to being grasped? And what is the grasping?
The eye is something that’s prone to being grasped.
The desire and greed for it is the grasping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind is something that’s prone to being grasped.
The desire and greed for it is the grasping.

Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts. The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts. The meeting of the three is contact.

When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha.
The Buddha saw him
and said,
“Monk, did you hear that exposition of the teaching?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learn that exposition of the teaching,
memorize it,
and remember it.
That exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.” &lt;/p&gt;

But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those mendicants went to Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;        “May Venerable Ānanda please explain this.” &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Ānanda said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Mendicants, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever in the world through which you perceive the world and conceive the world
is called the world in the training of the Noble One.
And through what in the world do you perceive the world and conceive the world? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the eye in the world you perceive the world and conceive the world.
Through the ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind in the world you perceive the world and conceive the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever in the world through which you perceive the world and conceive the world
is called the world in the training of the Noble One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Mendicants, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;         Then they said, “And Ānanda explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.” &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, Ānanda is astute, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Ānanda.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.” &lt;/p&gt;

‘My mind might often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me:
‘In my own way I should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, mendicants, your minds might also often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that you formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.
So in your own way you should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away.
You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief summary, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those mendicants went to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;          “May Venerable Ānanda please explain this.” &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. …” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Ānanda said this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away. You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was referring to the cessation of the six sense fields when he said:
‘So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away. You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha gave this brief summary, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.
And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;         Then they said, “And Ānanda explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.” &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, Ānanda is astute, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Ānanda.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, a mendicant pupil of mine has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s how it is, reverend, when someone doesn’t guard the sense doors, eats too much, and is not committed to wakefulness.
It’s not possible for such a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life.
But it is possible for a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life if they guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does someone guard the sense doors?
When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
That’s how someone guards the sense doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does someone eat in moderation?
It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
That’s how someone eats in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone committed to wakefulness?
It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.
In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.
In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.
That’s how someone is committed to wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should train like this:
‘We will guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and be committed to wakefulness.’
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula.
Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Rāhula,
“Rāhula, get your sitting cloth.
Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking,
“Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Rāhula?
Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are sights … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eye consciousness … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eye contact permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is the ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are thoughts … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind consciousness … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind contact permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said.
And while this discourse was being spoken, Rāhula’s mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Please, monks, think of women your mother’s age as your mother. Think of women your sister’s age as your sister. And think of women your daughter’s age as your daughter.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But Master Bhāradvāja, the mind is wanton.
Sometimes thoughts of desire come up even for women your mother’s age, your sister’s age, or your daughter’s age.
Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Please, monks, examine your own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life, maintaining it for a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is easy to do for those mendicants who have developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom.
But it’s hard to do for those mendicants who have not developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom.
Sometimes I plan to focus on something as ugly, but only its beauty comes to mind.
Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Please, monks, live with sense doors guarded.
When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve its restraint.
When you hear a sound with your ears …
When you smell an odor with your nose …
When you taste a flavor with your tongue …
When you feel a touch with your body …
When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, Master Bhāradvāja, it’s amazing!
How well this was said by the Buddha!
This is the real cause, this is the reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sometimes I too enter the harem with unprotected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times powerful thoughts of desire get the better of me.
But sometimes I enter the harem with protected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times such thoughts of desire don’t get the better of me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent, Master Bhāradvāja! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Bhāradvāja has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Bhāradvāja remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Householder, the eye element is found, as are agreeable sights, and eye consciousness.
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
The eye element is found, as are disagreeable sights, and eye consciousness.
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
The eye element is found, as are sights that are a basis for equanimity, and eye consciousness.
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind element is found, as are agreeable thoughts, and mind consciousness.

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to the eye …
ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
and mind?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me:
‘The pleasure and happiness that arise from the eye: this is its gratification.
That the eye is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the eye: this is its escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasure and happiness that arise from the ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind: this is its gratification.
That the mind is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the mind: this is its escape.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I didn’t truly understand these six interior sense fields’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I did truly understand these six interior sense fields’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge and vision arose in me:
‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the householder Hāliddikāni went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna … and asked him,
“Sir, this was said by the Buddha:
‘Diversity of elements gives rise to diversity of contacts, and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings.’
How does diversity of elements give rise to diversity of contacts, and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Householder, it’s when a mendicant sees a sight and understands it to be agreeable.
There is eye consciousness; and pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
Then they see a sight and understand it to be disagreeable.
There is eye consciousness; and painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
Then they see a sight and understand it to be a basis for equanimity.
There is eye consciousness; and neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant hears a sound with the ear …
smells an odor with the nose …
tastes a flavor with the tongue …
feels a touch with the body …
knows a thought with the mind and understands it to be agreeable.
There is mind consciousness; and pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
Then they know a thought and understand it to be disagreeable.
There is mind consciousness; and painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
Then they know a thought and understand it to be a basis for equanimity.
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how diversity of elements gives rise to diversity of contacts, and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then several youths, students of the brahmin Lohicca, approached Mahākaccāna’s wilderness hut while collecting firewood. They walked and wandered all around the hut, making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers:
“These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students,
“Students, stop being so noisy.
I will speak to you on the teaching.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this was said, the students fell silent.
Then Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brahmins of old excelled in ethics, &lt;br&gt;
and remembered the ancient traditions. &lt;br&gt;
Their sense doors were guarded, well protected, &lt;br&gt;
and they had mastered anger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those brahmins who remembered the ancient traditions &lt;br&gt;
enjoyed virtue and absorption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these have lost their way. Claiming to recite, &lt;br&gt;
they live out of balance, judging everyone by their clan. &lt;br&gt;
Mastered by anger, they take up many arms, &lt;br&gt;
attacking both the strong and the weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is vain for someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors, &lt;br&gt;
like the wealth a person finds in a dream. &lt;br&gt;
Fasting, sleeping on bare ground, &lt;br&gt;
bathing at dawn, the three Vedas, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rough hides, dreadlocks, and dirt, &lt;br&gt;
hymns, precepts and observances, and self-mortification, &lt;br&gt;
those fake bent staffs, &lt;br&gt;
and rinsing with water. &lt;br&gt;
These emblems of the brahmins &lt;br&gt;
are only used to generate profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mind that’s serene, &lt;br&gt;
clear and undisturbed, &lt;br&gt;
kind to all creatures: &lt;br&gt;
that’s the path to attainment of Brahmā!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those students, offended and upset, went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him,
“Please, master, you should know this. The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset.
Then he thought,
“But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students.
Why don’t I go and ask him about it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him,
“Master Kaccāna, did several young students of mine come by here collecting firewood?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They did, brahmin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But did you have some discussion with them?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what kind of discussion did you have with them?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the discussion I had with these students.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Mahākaccāna repeats the verses.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Master Kaccāna spoke of someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors.
How do you define someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they hear a sound with their ears … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they smell an odor with their nose … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they taste a flavor with their tongue … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they feel a touch with their body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how someone doesn’t guard the sense doors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, Master Kaccāna, it’s amazing!
How accurately you’ve explained someone whose sense doors are unguarded! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also spoke of someone who does guard the sense doors.
How do you define someone who does guard the sense doors?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they hear a sound with their ears … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they smell an odor with their nose … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they taste a flavor with their tongue … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they feel a touch with their body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how someone guards the sense doors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible, Master Kaccāna, it’s amazing!
How accurately you’ve explained someone whose sense doors are guarded!
Excellent, Master Kaccāna! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please come to my family just as you go to the families of the lay followers in Makkarakaṭa.
The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, and give you a seat and water. That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a boy who was a student of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan went up to Udāyī and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
Udāyī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that student with a Dhamma talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan and said to her,
“Please, madam, you should know this.
The ascetic Udāyī teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, madam,” he replied. He went to Udāyī and said,
“Sir, may Master Udāyī please accept an offering of tomorrow’s meal from my teacher’s wife, the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan.”
Udāyī consented in silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when the night had passed, Udāyī robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the brahmin lady’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, covered her head, and said to him,
“Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There will be an occasion for that, sister,” he replied, then got up from his seat and left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second time that student went to Venerable Udāyī … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a second time that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said to him, “You keep praising the ascetic Udāyī like this.
But when I asked him to preach the Dhamma he just said that there would be an occasion for that, and then he got up and left.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Madam, that’s because you put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, and covered your head before inviting him to teach.
For the masters respect the teaching.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, madam,” he replied. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she took off her shoes, sat on a low seat, uncovered her head, and said to him,
“Sir, when what exists do the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain? When what doesn’t exist do the perfected ones not declare that there is pleasure and pain?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sister, when there’s an eye, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no eye, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain.
When there’s an ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no mind, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, the brahmin lady said to Udāyī,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Udāyī has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Venerable Udāyī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” &lt;/p&gt;

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants, I don’t say that all mendicants have work to do with diligence, nor do I say that none of them have work to do with diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and become rightly freed through enlightenment.
Why is that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve done their work with diligence, and are incapable of negligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants do have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.
Why is that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sights known by the eye that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant.
Though experiencing them again and again they don’t occupy the mind.
Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi.
Seeing this fruit of diligence, I say that those mendicants have work to do with diligence when it comes to the six fields of contact. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thoughts known by the mind that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant.
Though experiencing them again and again they don’t occupy the mind.
Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi.
Seeing this fruit of diligence, I say that those mendicants have work to do with diligence when it comes to the six fields of contact.” &lt;/p&gt;

But when sights perish, fade away, and cease, gods and humans live in suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods and humans like sounds …
smells …
tastes …
touches …
thoughts, they love them and enjoy them.
But when thoughts perish, fade away, and cease, gods and humans live in suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Realized One has truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, so he doesn’t like, love, or enjoy them.
When sights perish, fade away, and cease, the Realized One lives happily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Realized One has truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sounds …
smells …
tastes …
touches …
thoughts, so he doesn’t like, love, or enjoy them.
When thoughts perish, fade away, and cease, the Realized One lives happily.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, &lt;br&gt;
touches and thoughts, the lot of them—&lt;br&gt;
they’re likable, desirable, and pleasurable &lt;br&gt;
as long as you can say that they exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the world with its gods, &lt;br&gt;
this is reckoned as happiness. &lt;br&gt;
And where they cease &lt;br&gt;
this is reckoned as suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noble ones have seen that happiness &lt;br&gt;
is the cessation of identity. &lt;br&gt;
Those who see &lt;br&gt;
contradict the whole world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What others say is happiness &lt;br&gt;
the noble ones say is suffering. &lt;br&gt;
What others say is suffering &lt;br&gt;
the noble ones say is happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, this teaching is hard to understand, &lt;br&gt;
it confuses the ignorant. &lt;br&gt;
Those who don’t see are closed off; &lt;br&gt;
for them, all is blind darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those who see are open; &lt;br&gt;
for the good, it is light. &lt;br&gt;
Though it’s right there, the unskilled fools &lt;br&gt;
don’t understand the teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re mired in desire to be reborn, &lt;br&gt;
flowing along the stream of lives, &lt;br&gt;
mired in Māra’s sovereignty: &lt;br&gt;
this teaching isn’t easy for them to understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, apart from the noble ones, &lt;br&gt;
is qualified to understand this state? &lt;br&gt;
When they’ve rightly understood it, &lt;br&gt;
they’re extinguished without defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause and condition that gives rise to thoughts is also not-self.
Since thoughts are produced by what is not-self, how could they be self? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this …
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;

Listen and pay close attention, I will speak. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is old action? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye is old action. It should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as something to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind is old action. It should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as something to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called old action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is new action? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeds you currently perform by way of body, speech, and mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called new action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the cessation of action? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you experience freedom due to the cessation of deeds by body, speech, and mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called the cessation of action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the practice that leads to the cessation of action? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called the practice that leads to the cessation of action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, mendicants, I’ve taught you old action, new action, the cessation of action, and the practice that leads to the cessation of action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” &lt;/p&gt;

Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that practice that’s conducive to extinguishment? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, mendicants?
Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are sights … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eye consciousness …
eye contact … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impermanent, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suffering, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they grow disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is that practice that’s conducive to extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;

‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is that method?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. When they have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’
When they don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’
Since this is so, are these things understood by faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aren’t they understood by seeing them with wisdom?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a method—apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration—that a mendicant can rely on to declare their enlightenment. That is:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a mendicant hears a sound … smells an odor … tastes a flavor … feels a touch … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;knows a thought with the mind. When they have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’
When they don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’
Since this is so, are these things understood by faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration?” &lt;/p&gt;

Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”&lt;/p&gt;

That’s just a large body of water, a large sea of water.
For a person, the eye is an ocean,
and its currents are made of sights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who can withstand those currents is said to have crossed over the ocean of the eye, with its waves and whirlpools, its sharks and monsters.
Crossed over, the brahmin stands on the far shore. &lt;/p&gt;

Crossed over, the brahmin stands on the far shore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A knowledge master who’s crossed the ocean so hard to cross, &lt;br&gt;
with its sharks and monsters, its waves, whirlpools, and dangers; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
This is called the ocean in the training of the Noble One.
And it’s here that this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—is for the most part sunk. It’s become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve escaped their chains, given up death, and have no attachments. &lt;br&gt;
They’ve given up suffering, so there are no more future lives. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, I will teach you the all.
Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the all?
It’s just the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and thoughts.
This is called the all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendicants, suppose someone was to say:
‘I’ll reject this all and describe another all.’ They’d have no grounds for that,
they’d be stumped by questions, and, in addition, they’d get frustrated.
Why is that?
Because they’re out of their element.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, there are these six hooks in the world that mean tragedy and slaughter for living creatures.
What six? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them,
they’re called a mendicant who has swallowed Māra’s hook. They’ve met with tragedy and disaster, and the Wicked One can do what he wants with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sounds … smells … tastes … touches … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thoughts known by the mind that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Sāriputta, which is it? Is the eye the fetter of sights, or are sights the fetter of the eye?
Is the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind the fetter of thoughts, or are thoughts the fetter of the mind?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Koṭṭhita, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.
The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind is not the fetter of thoughts, nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke.
Would it be right to say that
the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, reverend.
The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox.
The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.
The ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind is not the fetter of thoughts, nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind.
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the eye were the fetter of sights, or if sights were the fetter of the eye, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found.
However, since this is not the case, but
the fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;

However, since this is not the case, but
the fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too is a way to understand how this is so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha has an eye
with which he sees a sight.
But he has no desire and greed,
for his mind is well freed.
The Buddha has an ear …
nose …
tongue …
The Buddha has a body
with which he senses touch.
But he has no desire and greed,
for his mind is well freed.
The Buddha has a mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with which he knows thought.
But he has no desire and greed,
for his mind is well freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too is a way to understand how the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.

&lt;p&gt;Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Udāyī came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Ānanda, the Buddha has explained, opened, and illuminated in many ways how this body is not-self.
Is it possible to explain consciousness in the same way? To teach, assert, establish, open, analyze, and make it clear how consciousness is not-self?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “It is possible, Reverend Udāyī. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does eye consciousness arise dependent on the eye and sights?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the cause and condition that gives rise to eye consciousness were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over, would eye consciousness still be found?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, reverend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this way, too, it can be understood how consciousness is not-self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does ear … nose … tongue … body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind consciousness arise dependent on the mind and thoughts?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, reverend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the cause and condition that gives rise to mind consciousness were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over, would mind consciousness still be found?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, reverend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this way, too, it can be understood how consciousness is not-self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the root, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant sees these six fields of contact as neither self nor belonging to self.
So seeing, they don’t grasp anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” &lt;/p&gt;

Listen … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the exposition of the teaching on burning? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off mutilating your eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in sights known by the eye.
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations:
hell or the animal realm.
I speak having seen this drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off mutilating your ear faculty with a sharp iron spike … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off mutilating your nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off mutilating your tongue faculty with a sharp razor … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off mutilating your body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in touches known by the body.
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations:
hell or the animal realm.
I speak having seen this drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be better off sleeping.
For I say that sleep is useless, fruitless, and unconsciousness for the living. But while you’re asleep you won’t fall under the sway of such thoughts that would make you create a schism in the Saṅgha.
I speak having seen this drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A noble disciple reflects on this:
‘Forget mutilating the eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget mutilating the ear faculty with a sharp iron spike, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the ear, sounds, ear consciousness, and ear contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by ear contact is also impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget mutilating the nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the nose, smells, nose consciousness, and nose contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by nose contact is also impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget mutilating the tongue faculty with a sharp razor, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the tongue, tastes, tongue consciousness, and tongue contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by tongue contact is also impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget mutilating the body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the body, touches, body consciousness, and body contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by body contact is also impermanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget sleeping!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also impermanent.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact.
They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exposition of the teaching on burning.” &lt;/p&gt;

What three? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they hear a sound with their ears … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they smell an odor with their nose … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they taste a flavor with their tongue … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they feel a touch with their body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready. Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant trains to protect, control, tame, and pacify these six senses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant eat in moderation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a person who puts ointment on a wound only so that it can heal; or who oils an axle only so that it can carry a load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is a mendicant committed to wakefulness? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.
In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.
In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how a mendicant is committed to wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mendicant has these three qualities they’re full of joy and happiness in the present life, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say to him,
‘Mister, here are four lethal poisonous vipers. They must be periodically picked up, washed, fed, and put to sleep.
But when one or other of these four poisonous vipers gets angry with you, you’ll meet with death or deadly pain.
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers, would flee this way or that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there are five deadly enemies chasing you, thinking: “When we catch sight of him, we’ll murder him right there!”
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies, would flee this way or that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there’s a sixth hidden killer chasing you with a drawn sword, thinking: “When I catch sight of him, I’ll chop off his head right there!”
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer, would flee this way or that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d see an empty village.
But whatever house he enters is vacant, deserted, and empty.
And whatever vessel he touches is vacant, hollow, and empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there are bandits who raid villages, and they’re striking now.
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer and the bandits, would flee this way or that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d see a large deluge, whose near shore is dubious and perilous, while the far shore is a sanctuary free of peril.
But there’s no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that man thought,
‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that man did exactly that. Having crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin stands on the far shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Four lethal poisonous vipers’ is a term for the four primary elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, and air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Five deadly enemies’ is a term for the five grasping aggregates, that is:
form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The sixth hidden killer with a drawn sword’ is a term for relishing and greed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Empty village’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.
If an astute, competent, clever person investigates this in relation to the eye, it appears vacant, hollow, and empty.
If an astute, competent, clever person investigates this in relation to the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind, it appears vacant, hollow, and empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Bandits who raid villages’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields.
The eye is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable sights.
The ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Large deluge’ is a term for the four floods:
the floods of sensual pleasures, desire to be reborn, views, and ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The near shore that’s dubious and perilous’ is a term for identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The far shore, a sanctuary free of peril’ is a term for extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The raft’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Paddling with hands and feet’ is a term for being energetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on the shore’ is a term for a perfected one.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ear … nose …

mind should be given up. Thoughts should be given up. Mind consciousness should be given up. Mind contact should be given up. The painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact should be given up. &lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, a jackal was also hunting along the river bank.
The tortoise saw the jackal off in the distance hunting,
so it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell, and kept passive and silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the jackal also saw the tortoise off in the distance grazing.
So it went up to the tortoise and waiting nearby, thinking,
‘When that tortoise sticks one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, I’ll grab it right there, rip it out, and eat it!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when that tortoise didn’t stick one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, the jackal left disappointed, since it couldn’t find a vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Māra the Wicked is always waiting nearby, thinking:
‘Hopefully I can find a vulnerability in the eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, or
mind.’
That’s why you should live with sense doors guarded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear a sound with your ears … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you smell an odor with your nose … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you taste a flavor with your tongue … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel a touch with your body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you live with your sense doors restrained, Māra will leave you disappointed, since he can’t find a vulnerability,
just like the jackal left the tortoise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mendicant should collect their thoughts &lt;br&gt;
as a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell. &lt;br&gt;
Independent, not disturbing others, &lt;br&gt;
someone who’s extinguished wouldn’t blame anyone.” &lt;/p&gt;

Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current,
he addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” they replied. …
When this was said, Venerable Kimbila said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?” … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what, Kimbila, is rotting away?
It’s when a mendicant has committed the kind of corrupt offense from which there is no rehabilitation.
This is called ‘rotting away’.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current,
he addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants, do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicants, assume that that tree trunk doesn’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And assume that it doesn’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that it doesn’t rot away.
In that case, that tree trunk will slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean.
Why is that?
Because the current of the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines towards the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, assume that you don’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And assume that you don’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that you don’t rot away.
In that case, you will slant, slope, and incline towards extinguishment.
Why is that?
Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘The near shore’, mendicant, is a term for the six interior sense fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The far shore’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sinking in the middle’ is a term for greed and relishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Stranded on high ground’ is a term for the conceit ‘I am’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s getting taken by humans?
It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business.
That’s called getting taken by humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s getting taken by non-humans?
It’s when someone leads the spiritual life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods: ‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’
That’s called getting taken by non-humans.
‘Caught up in a whirlpool’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s rotting away?
It’s when some person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved.
This is called ‘rotting away’.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was sitting not far from the Buddha.
Then he said to the Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I won’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And I won’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and I won’t rot away.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, Nanda, return the cows to their owners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, the cows will go back by themselves, since they love their calves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Still, Nanda, you should return them to their owners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Nanda, after returning the cows to their owners, went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“Sir, I have returned the cows to their owners.
May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the cowherd Nanda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination,
Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected. &lt;/p&gt;

then they’ve seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures.
And they’ve awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does a mendicant truly understand the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling …
perception …
choices …
consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how has a mendicant seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. Then two strong men grab would grab each arm and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. They’d writhe and struggle to and fro.
Why is that?
For that person knows, ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a mendicant has seen sensual pleasures as like a pit of glowing coals, they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how has a mendicant awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a person was to enter a thicket full of thorns. They’d have thorns in front and behind, to the left and right, below and above. So they’d go forward mindfully and come back mindfully, thinking, ‘May I not get any thorns!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant is called a thorn in the training of the Noble One.
When they understand what a thorn is, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone unrestrained? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …
know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how someone is unrestrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone restrained? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …
know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how someone is restrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way, every so often they might lose mindfulness, and bad, unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise. If this happens, their mindfulness is slow to come up, but they quickly give them up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day, and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto it. The drops would be slow to fall, but they’d quickly dry up and evaporate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way, every so often they might lose mindfulness, and bad, unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise. If this happens, their mindfulness is slow to come up, but they quickly give them up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how a mendicant has awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that mendicant conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way, it may be that rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family would invite them to accept wealth, saying,
‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you?
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’
But it’s simply impossible for a mendicant who conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way to resign the training and return to a lesser life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: ‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, mendicants?
Would they still succeed?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.
Why is that?
The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west.
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way, while that mendicant conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way, it may be that rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying,
‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you?
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’
But it’s simply impossible for a mendicant who conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way to resign the training and return to a lesser life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?
Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life.” &lt;/p&gt;

“Reverend, at what point is a mendicant’s vision well purified?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the six sense fields, at that point their vision is well purified.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content with that answer, that mendicant went up to a series of other mendicants and received the following answers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the five grasping aggregates, at that point their vision is well purified.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the four primary elements, at that point their vision is well purified.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a mendicant truly understands that everything that has a beginning has an end, at that point their vision is well purified.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content with any of those answers, that mendicant went up to the Buddha and told him what had happened. Then he asked,
“Sir, at what point is a mendicant’s vision well purified?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mendicant, suppose a person had never seen a parrot tree.
They’d go up to someone who had seen a parrot tree and ask them,
‘Mister, what’s a parrot tree like?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say,
‘A parrot tree is blackish, like a charred stump.’
Now, at that time a parrot tree may well have been just as that person saw it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content with that answer, that person would go up to a series of other people and receive the following answers:
‘A parrot tree is reddish, like a lump of meat.’
‘A parrot tree has flaking bark and burst pods, like an acacia.’
‘A parrot tree has luxuriant, shady foliage, like a banyan.’
Now, at each of those times a parrot tree may well have been just as those people saw them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, those good people each answered according to what they were focused on when their vision was well purified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and six gates.
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swift pair of messengers would arrive from the east and say to the gatekeeper,
‘Mister, where is the lord of the city?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say,
‘There he is, sirs, seated at the central square.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that swift pair of messengers would deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swift pair of messengers would come from the west …
north …
south …
deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘City’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Six gates’ is a term for the six interior sense fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Gatekeeper’ is a term for mindfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘A swift pair of messengers’ is a term for serenity and discernment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The lord of the city’ is a term for consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The central square’ is a term for the four primary elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, and air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘A message of truth’ is a term for extinguishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The way they came’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is,
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.” &lt;/p&gt;

‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it’s a wrong turn, a bad path, a harmful way.
This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people.
It’s not worthy of you.’
The mind should be shielded from this when it comes to sights known by the eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any monk or nun who has desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion come up for sounds … smells … tastes … touches …
thoughts known by the mind should shield their mind against them:
‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it’s a wrong turn, a bad path, a harmful way.
This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people.
It’s not worthy of you.’
The mind should be shielded from this when it comes to thoughts known by the mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the crops have ripened,
but the caretaker is negligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops they’d indulge themselves as much as they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when an uneducated ordinary person doesn’t exercise restraint when it comes to the six fields of contact, they indulge themselves in the five kinds of sensual stimulation as much as they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the crops have ripened, and the caretaker is diligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops
the caretaker would grab them firmly by the muzzle.
Then they’d grab them above the hump and hold them fast there.
Then they’d give them a good thrashing
before driving them away.
For a second time,
and even a third time, the same thing might happen.
As a result, no matter how long they stand or sit in a village or wilderness, that ox fond of crops would never invade that crop again,
remembering the beating they got earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is subdued, well subdued when it comes to the six fields of contact, becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a king or their minister had never heard the sound of an arched harp.
When he first hears the sound,
he’d say,
‘My man, what is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say to him,
‘That, sir, is an arched harp.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d say,
‘Go, my man, fetch me that arched harp.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they’d fetch it
and say,
‘This, sir, is that arched harp.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d say,
‘I’ve had enough of that arched harp! Just fetch me the sound.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d say,
‘Sir, this arched harp is made of many components assembled together,
which make a sound when they’re played. That is,
it depends on the body, the skin, the neck, the head, the strings, the plectrum, and a person to play it properly. That’s how an arched harp is made of many components assembled together,
which make a sound when they’re played.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he’d split that harp into ten pieces or a hundred pieces, then splinter it up.
He’d burn the splinters with fire, and reduce them to ashes.
Then he’d sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he’d say,
‘It seems that there’s nothing to this thing called an arched harp or whatever’s called an arched harp! But people waste their time with it, negligent and heedless!’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a mendicant searches for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness anywhere they might be reborn.
As they search in this way,
their thoughts of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’ are no more.” &lt;/p&gt;

The kusa thorns would pierce their feet, and the reed leaves would scratch their limbs.
And that would cause that person to experience even more pain and distress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, some mendicant goes to a village or a wilderness and gets scolded,
‘This venerable, acting like this, behaving like this, is a filthy village thorn.’
Understanding that they’re a thorn, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone unrestrained? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they hear a sound with their ears … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they smell an odor with their nose … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they taste a flavor with their tongue … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they feel a touch with their body … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope.
They’d catch a snake,
a crocodile,
a bird,
a dog,
a jackal,
and a monkey,
tie each up with a strong rope, then tie a knot in the middle and let them loose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory.
The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, the strongest of them would get their way, and they’d all have to submit to their control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye pulls towards pleasant sights, but is put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts, but is put off by unpleasant thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how someone is unrestrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is someone restrained? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …
know a thought with their mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope.
They’d catch a snake,
a crocodile,
a bird,
a dog,
a jackal,
and a monkey,
tie each up with a strong rope, then tether them to a strong post or pillar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory.
The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, they’d stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye doesn’t pull towards pleasant sights, and isn’t put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind doesn’t pull towards pleasant thoughts, and isn’t put off by unpleasant thoughts.
This is how someone is restrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘A strong post or pillar’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should train like this:
‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’
That’s how you should train.” &lt;/p&gt;

Then six people would come along carrying flails,
and started threshing the sheaf of barley.
So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails.
Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail,
and they’d give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing.
So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights.
They’re struck in the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts.
And if that uneducated ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck, like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons,
‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three,
‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.
So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck.
That is, until he thought,
‘It’s the gods who are principled, while the demons are unprincipled. Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods.’
Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck. He entertained himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he thought,
‘It’s the demons who are principled, while the gods are unprincipled. Now I will go over there to the castle of the demons,’
he found himself bound by his limbs and neck, and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how subtly Vepacitti was bound.
But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that.
When you identify, you’re bound by Māra. Not identifying, you’re free from the Wicked One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that does not identify.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all disturbances: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Disturbances are a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of disturbances.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all tremblings: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Trembling is a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of tremblings.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all proliferations: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Proliferation is a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of proliferation.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all conceits: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that has struck down conceit.’” &lt;/p&gt;

And what is the all, without directly knowing and completely understanding which, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without directly knowing and completely understanding the eye, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering.
Without directly knowing and completely understanding sights …
eye consciousness …
eye contact …
painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without directly knowing and completely understanding the ear … the nose … the tongue …
the body …
the mind, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering.
Without directly knowing and completely understanding thoughts …
mind consciousness …
mind contact …
painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the all, without directly knowing and completely understanding which, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By directly knowing and completely understanding the all, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering.
And what is the all, directly knowing and completely understanding which, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By directly knowing and completely understanding the eye …
the ear … the nose … the tongue …
the body …
the mind, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering.
By directly knowing and completely understanding thoughts …
mind consciousness …
mind contact …
painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the all, directly knowing and completely understanding which, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering.” &lt;/p&gt;
